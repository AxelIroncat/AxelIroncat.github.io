        <h1>Chapter 35: The Coliseum</h1>

        <p>The corridor by the elevator was steeped in a tense, suffocating silence. The air was stiflingly warm, smelling of dust and heated plastic. Max cautiously stepped forward. The light in the foyer wasn’t working, but his eyes quickly adjusted to the gloom. Up ahead, the exit loomed, leading outside. Suspiciously empty. Too empty. He raised his left arm, activating the protective field on his bracer, and whispered, “Too quiet…”</p>
        <p>Behind him, Lis and Royce moved in silence, shielding Richard Vale—Lis’s father—and the limp prisoner draped over Royce’s shoulder. Lis’s heart still pounded from their recent reunion: her father could barely stand, but he was alive. She squeezed his hand and whispered, “Hold on, Dad…” Max gestured for them to stay back, and then he stepped outside, every sound setting his nerves on edge.</p>
        <p>Twilight had deepened over the base. Cold beams from the perimeter spotlights sliced through the darkness, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt of the courtyard. Twenty soldiers in heavy armor stood arrayed before the entrance. Helmets hid their faces behind opaque visors, their bodies wrapped in composite plating. Automatic rifles gleamed in their hands. At the center of the formation, like a conductor before an orchestra of death, stood Friedrich Steiner—helmetless, a predatory smirk carved across his pale face. He was waiting.</p>
        <p>“Max. Lis… Royce…” Steiner drawled, folding his hands behind his back. His voice sounded almost welcoming. “What a predictable ending. Did you really think you could just walk away?”</p>
        <p>Max stepped forward silently, feeling his fingers go cold from tension. Lis darted out of the elevator to stand at his side, her posture sharp with resolve. Royce stayed just behind, still holding the unconscious captive.</p>
        <p>“I must admit, you’ve impressed me,” Steiner continued with feigned curiosity, slowly pacing under the beam of a spotlight. “And yet… everything you’ve done has led you right here. I calculated every one of your moves long ago. Lis, my dear, in searching for your father, you couldn’t help but end up in this lair. And you, Max… you consider yourself so clever. You bypassed so many traps with your gadgets. But you were predictable. You came to me like obedient pawns.”</p>
        <p>Lis clenched her fists but said nothing, her burning gaze fixed on the enemy. Max felt anger simmering inside him, but he held it back—he needed a clear head now.</p>
        <p>Steiner stopped, narrowing his eyes. “My order is simple. I need Max alive. As for the girl and the brute…” He smirked. “Whatever happens.”</p>
        <p>Tension hung in the air, as if the night itself held its breath. For a second, everyone froze. Max slowly shifted his gaze to Lis. She met his eyes—there was steel in those bright depths. <i>Surrender? Never.</i> Royce adjusted the burden on his shoulder. Max gave a brief nod to his friends.</p>
        <p>“And you really thought we’d obey?” he challenged Steiner, his voice ringing with defiance.</p>
        <p>Steiner spread his arms, as if inviting them to look around. “As you wish. The choice is made.”</p>
        <p>Steiner was already backing away, ducking behind his soldiers. His hand touched his earpiece—he murmured a command. Max didn’t catch it, nor did he try. He focused on the enemies as the soldiers tightened their grips on their weapons, reorganizing into a tight circle.</p>
        <p>“Take them alive!” Steiner’s sharp command crackled across the courtyard. “If they resist—cripple them!”</p>
        <p>At that instant, all the enemy rifles flew upward, slung behind their backs. In the soldiers’ hands, electric batons crackled to life—long metal rods spitting a bluish electrical discharge. Capture, but not kill. Steiner only needed Max… The realization stabbed at Max’s chest, igniting a fierce resolve.</p>
        <p>“Back to the building!” Max shouted over his shoulder, but he himself stayed, bracing to cover his comrades’ retreat.</p>
        <p>Lis and Royce didn’t hesitate. Royce spun and bolted back into the hall, carefully but swiftly lowering the unconscious body to the floor. Lis practically dragged her weakened father, settling him onto a shabby sofa by the wall. Richard tried to protest, but Lis gently pressed him down by the shoulders. “You always protected me before… Now it’s my turn. I can handle it, Dad. You have no idea what superpowers I have now!” She touched his hand—confidence flared in her eyes, mixed with a dangerous spark of excitement. Her lips twitched in a smile.</p>
        <p>Outside, the duel was already unfolding. Two soldiers rushed at Max, aiming to grapple him. Max stayed behind to cover his friends’ escape. He darted to the center of the courtyard and raised his left arm. A dry crack sounded—a shimmering force field blossomed in front of him. The first soldier brought his baton down directly onto the barely visible shield. The electric jolt struck uselessly against empty air, bursting into blue sparks. Max even felt a pang of pity for the man—he had no idea there was a wall in his way.</p>
        <p>The second soldier came at him from the flank, swinging his baton in a wide arc. Max caught the movement at the edge of his vision and kicked sideways, slapping a button on his belt at the same time. A protective hemispheric field flashed around him for an instant—like a soap bubble encasing him, then popping. The baton slammed into that fleeting bubble. The blow didn’t hit Max directly, but the vibration rippled through the field, painfully rattling his whole body. Max winced; he couldn’t keep this up for long.</p>
        <p>A heavy footstep thudded behind him—a third assailant had crept up, poised to smash the back of Max’s skull. But Max was ready. He spun around, his right hand already clamped on the hilt of his trump card. The blade-sword—born of a concentrated energy field—shot forward without a sound, like a ghost. A soft light glided along the weapon’s smooth edge. The descending baton met not the back of Max’s head, but the cold flash of that blade. A scream rang out—Max’s single sweeping strike sheared off the tip of the baton, along with a couple of the attacker’s fingers. The soldier howled and crumpled to his knees, clutching his maimed hand.</p>
        <p>Another soldier lunged in at that vulnerable moment. Max couldn’t react in time—the baton slammed into the inside of his knee. The electric discharge seared into the muscle like a red-hot needle. Pain ripped through his body, and Max jerked and collapsed onto one knee. The blade-sword slipped from his grasp, skittered across the asphalt, and came to rest a few meters away.</p>
        <p>The soldiers realized the moment had come. One was already grabbing at Max to restrain him, the second was raising his baton for another blow. Max tried to push himself up, but his muscles wouldn’t obey. Everything was happening too fast.</p>
        <p>At that moment, a shadow flitted behind Max. From deep in the doorway, a swift figure burst out. Lis! She had waited for the enemies to fixate on Max—now, with a running start from the hall, she leaped in a way no ordinary person could.</p>
        <p>“You still can’t use it anyway,” came Lis’s voice, full of stubbornness and barely concealed amusement, cutting through the chaos of battle.</p>
        <p>Lis slid in front of him as if on ice. Max couldn’t fathom it—how had she learned to harness all the dynamic field’s capabilities so quickly? What had taken him weeks of training—attempts, trials, and errors—this girl had mastered almost at once. She had even figured out how to exploit the field’s gliding effect. Crouching low, she skimmed between one soldier’s legs and under another’s whistling baton. And she did it all in heels! At the last second, she reached out—and the hilt of the blade-sword that Max had dropped smoothly rolled into her palm, as if returning to its owner.</p>
        <p>Lis skidded to a stop and immediately sprang up beside Max. She drew the attention of the soldier who was already poised to bring his baton down on Max. “You know, we had fencing lessons in school,” she said lightly, “but the foils were never <i>this</i> sharp. A pity.”</p>
        <p>A blur of motion—nearly invisible, like a wisp of wind. Lis’s blade shot forward and pierced the soldier’s forearm through his armor. The man didn’t even realize why his baton had been ripped from his grip. An instant later, he staggered back with a cry of pain.</p>
        <p>Lis stepped in front of Max, raising the sword to her face as she assumed an elegant fencer’s stance—knees slightly bent, body straight, elbow back, blade extended forward. She tilted her head as if evaluating the remaining soldiers. “Well, boys… who wants to try again?”</p>
        <p>They tried—foolishly. One came first: a powerful brute swinging two batons. Lis sidestepped, ducked under his sweeping strike, and as she spun, delivered a precise thrust to the back of his knee. A neat, surgical cut. His armor might as well not have existed—her blade slipped right through. The soldier doubled over with a scream.</p>
        <p>The second charged in immediately, trying to catch her from the side. Lis twirled—the sword in her hand traced a figure-eight, slicing off half of his baton and then shearing away his shoulder plate along with its fastening. The fabric beneath tore open, and the hunk of armor fell to the asphalt with a dull <i>thud</i>. Judging by his howl of pain, her blade had cut into flesh as well.</p>
        <p>The third held back, trying to wait her out. Lis narrowed her eyes, a predatory glint in them. “All right... wait there. I’ll come to you.”</p>
        <p>She darted forward—not running, but <i>jumping</i>. She hurled herself straight at him, pushing off a concrete ledge with her heels. The air seemed to freeze; everything slowed. In that suspended heartbeat, she spun in midair, sword held at an angle.</p>
        <p>The blade struck the front plate of his armor—not stabbing through, but slashing sideways, shearing through the fastenings and literally <i>undressing</i> him. He staggered, and Lis was already moving on—pushing off his shoulder as if it were a step. She flipped in the air and landed right behind the next fighter. “Excuse me. I’m just playing now.”</p>
        <p>Her sword flickered—another swift cut—and that enemy collapsed forward, clutching his thigh.</p>
        <p>Now the remaining soldiers all halted. They understood: this white-haired girl with the almost invisible sword was not prey. She was a hurricane.</p>
        <p>The opponents no longer charged in blindly, realizing how deadly she was. Lis quickly saw that she was surrounded. Five—no, six—of them were tightening the circle. These armored hulks, each brandishing a baton, moved like parts of a single mechanism. She could evade—yes—but not for long. To the side—a shadow. Behind—a heavy step. In front—a gaze behind a mirrored visor. They waited. So did she.</p>
        <p>Then everything happened in a split second.</p>
        <p>Lis feinted forward, crouched—and suddenly blasted upward as if propelled by an invisible explosion. The booster in her heels clicked, hurling her up and out of the ring. She sailed over the heads of the two nearest soldiers, twisting in midair, and as she spun, her sword carved a wide arc—and struck.</p>
        <p>The first soldier clutched at his shoulder; his arm went limp—severed at the joint. The second didn’t even have time to turn: the blade jabbed precisely into his buttock, straight through the armor, and he crashed to the ground with a gasp, his body arching in pain.</p>
        <p>From the side, three of them charged her at once. Lis seemed to <i>sense</i> their approach. She turned her back to one and sprinted toward a concrete ledge. A jump. She kicked off—and again she was airborne, vaulting directly over their heads. One tried to swing a baton at her, but didn’t make it in time. Another grabbed for her, but his hands closed on nothing.</p>
        <p>Lis landed behind the third. She pivoted—and her blade drew a sharp line across the back of his knee. The soldier fell with a dull groan.</p>
        <p>Immediately, the first one whirled and lunged for her arm. Lis slipped away like water, and suddenly she was <i>behind</i> him. One precise thrust—and his shoulder armor split open. He flailed, but too late: her sword slashed his wrist. The baton flew from his hand.</p>
        <p>The last soldier in this bout was right behind her. He leapt—Lis let him get close. And the moment his arms scooped at empty air, she shot straight <i>up</i>.</p>
        <p>Like a circus acrobat, she flipped backward in midair and came down with a boot on each of his shoulders, her arms out wide for balance. The soldier had no idea where she’d gone. With a triumphant grin, Lis planted one heel atop his helmet. Then, flashing a predatory smile, she triggered her jump booster once more. She vaulted off him, rocketing high into the air. The repulsor blast from her takeoff slammed into him full-force, and he crumpled face-first onto the asphalt.</p>
        <p>A few of the remaining soldiers finally started using their heads. They realized that chasing this girl was a losing proposition—she wasn’t just a target now; she was a problem. Too fast, too precise, and—frankly—too humiliating to fight. So three of them suddenly shifted tactics.</p>
        <p>They spun around and charged straight for Max.</p>
        <p>He was just struggling to rise, propping himself up with a trembling arm. His muscles still wouldn’t obey after the shock, and his blade-sword… was with Lis. There was no way he could defend himself.</p>
        <p>One soldier was nearly upon him already, baton raised high. A second was circling to strike from behind. A third chose the flank, ready to slam him down and pin him. Max tried to stand, but his leg buckled treacherously. He saw the blow coming, and he knew this was the end.</p>
        <p>But the blow never landed. A locomotive plowed into them.</p>
        <p>There was a heavy rumble of footfalls and then—a thunderous <i>crash</i>. Royce.</p>
        <p>He barreled into the squad like a runaway armored truck. The first soldier didn’t even know what hit him—he just flew backward, describing a high arc and landing on his back with a metallic crunch. The second received a field-augmented punch to the chest—his breastplate cracked, and he collapsed sideways with a groan, like a sack of sand.</p>
        <p>The third managed to start a swing with his baton, but Royce was already there. Royce caught the blow with an open palm; the shield flashed, absorbing the impact. In the same instant, an uppercut from below launched the soldier off his feet. He slammed to the ground, his helmet clanging against the pavement.</p>
        <p>Max blinked. “What took you so long?” he muttered, hauling himself upright.</p>
        <p>“I was admiring our princess. There’s a theory she’s either a genetic mutant or a WMD—a weapon of mass destruction the corporation cooked up,” Royce chuckled as he moved to stand beside Max.</p>
        <p>Lis, still in the thick of the fight, retorted without even turning, her tone bright with mirth: “Keep talking and I might just mistake you for a cooking pot—and hit you so hard your insides leak out of a brand new hole!”</p>
        <p>“And aggressive, too!” Royce snorted. “No wonder the city lunatics call her ‘Majesty’… She was probably the head of their ward.” He raised his fists again.</p>
        <p>Max, almost under his breath, either said or thought: <i>Yeah… she struck me at first sight.</i></p>
        <p>Six of Steiner’s soldiers still stood—experienced and wary. They had seen how fast and precise Lis was, and they no longer tried to take her one-on-one. Instead, they spread out in a semicircle, like wolves preparing to pounce.</p>
        <p>Royce stepped up beside Lis, shoulder to shoulder. His breathing was heavy, his fists in their field gloves clenching and unclenching. He was in no rush. “I’ll take the ones on the right,” he growled.</p>
        <p>“Then I have three,” Lis replied with a smirk. “You don’t mind if I break them a little, do you?”</p>
        <p>“Do whatever you want with your toys,” Royce grumbled.</p>
        <p>His answer was the sharp <i>click</i> of Lis’s blade-sword springing back to life in her hand.</p>
        <p>The enemies charged almost simultaneously. One came straight at Royce, slashing a baton down at him diagonally. Royce didn’t bother to dodge: he raised his arm, and his shield intercepted the strike. In the next breath, Royce’s fist crunched into the attacker’s chest plate—the man doubled over and fell face-down. Royce’s field-enhanced punches hit these soldiers as if they were made of straw.</p>
        <p>A second foe tried to swing around Royce’s side, but Royce pivoted his whole body—and struck. The air before his fist shimmered as an invisible force blasted the enemy off his feet. The soldier’s body flew back a meter, carving a furrow in the asphalt.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lis fought in an entirely different rhythm. Her every step was like a dance, each turn perfectly balanced. She feinted toward her first attacker as if intending to go left, then suddenly sprang right, leaning in. Her sword swept upward from below—cutting the fastening on the arm that held his baton. The weapon fell, and the soldier stumbled back, not daring to continue unarmed.</p>
        <p>The second hesitated, and Lis lunged at him immediately. Not for his chest—for his knee. The nearly invisible blade slid into his thigh without resistance… The soldier toppled onto his side, unable to rise.</p>
        <p>The third was more cautious, keeping his distance with his baton extended. Lis didn’t leap yet. She took one step, then another, sideways—almost teasing him with the distance. The opponent edged toward her—and then she suddenly burst forward, skimming low along the ground. Her sword ripped open the fastening on his boot, then—like a whip—slashed the inside of his thigh. Once again, the supposedly “perfect” armor didn’t save him. The man howled, clutching his leg.</p>
        <p>“Please, don’t whine,” Lis sighed. “And by the way, boys, couldn’t you groan… a little more gratefully? You’re still breathing, after all.”</p>
        <p>In response, there were only a couple of stifled groans—whether from pain or embarrassment was unclear.</p>
        <p>One of the soldiers, seizing the moment, tried to creep up behind Royce. Royce was busy with another and didn’t notice the attacker on his blind side. It looked like the enemy’s strike would land.</p>
        <p>But Max was back on his feet now, leaning against the wall. He saw the danger. He raised his left hand and—<i>click</i>, <i>flash</i>. An invisible repulsive field blasted forward like a battering ram. The soldier jerked as if he’d hit a wall, then went flying backward into a metal railing with a crash.</p>
        <p>“Thanks,” Royce grunted, not even turning.</p>
        <p>“You’re welcome,” Max rasped in reply.</p>
        <p>The last remaining soldier froze. Around him lay bodies—knocked down, writhing, scattered like debris after a storm. He glanced at Lis—a white-haired figure in the shadows, sword in hand, utterly calm, as if all this had been just a warm-up. The soldier took one step back, then another, and without waiting for an order, dropped his baton. The metal rod clanged on the asphalt. Slowly, he raised his hands high above his head.</p>
        <p>“Smart,” Royce said approvingly.</p>
        <p>“And intact,” Lis added, retracting her blade into its hilt. “That’s even more important.”</p>
        <p>She walked past the surrendering enemy as if he no longer existed, and approached Max. He stood leaning against the wall, reflections of the battle still flickering in his eyes. In silence, Lis offered him the hilt of the blade-sword. “You’re still better with it,” she murmured, not quite meeting his eyes.</p>
        <p>Max took it, grimacing slightly as pain shot through his stiff muscles. The hilt settled into his palm as if it had come home. “Thank <i>you</i>,” he said quietly.</p>
        <p>Lis turned to go, but then suddenly stopped and glanced back over her shoulder. “Oh, and by the way…” she said, narrowing her eyes. “When all this is over—make me a rapier just like this. Only pink. Or, you know, something pretty. Got it?”</p>
        <p>Max smirked, slowly flexing his fingers. “You’ll get the finest one,” he promised. “And even sharper.”</p>
        <p>Lis nodded, satisfied. Then, almost in a whisper, she added: “Just make sure it’s cooler than yours.”</p>
        <p>A low hum came first—a deep vibration, as if someone had fired up an industrial engine beneath the city. The ground trembled. And then—it appeared.</p>
        <p>A grotesque colossus, towering at least three times the height of a man, stepped into the courtyard, its long metallic limbs easily clearing the perimeter wall. Dark gray plating glinted with military markings. It had no human-like arms, no human features—just a killing machine built for war. Mounted on its right side was a six-barreled minigun on a raised platform; on its left, a pod of missiles bristled like a scorpion’s tail. Every movement came with the whine and clank of servos, and thin orange lines pulsed along its neck—a telltale glow venting heat from the reactor buried under its armor.</p>
        <p>Max’s eyes locked on the cockpit. Behind thick, reflective glass, he could make out a silhouette. A pilot. Alive. Watching. And that gaze was now fixed on them.</p>
        <p>“Wow,” Lis breathed, narrowing her eyes. “Looks like someone has something to prove.”</p>
        <p>The giant machine halted in the center of the courtyard, standing by for orders. Steiner, who had lingered by the wall all this time, spoke into his earpiece with a satisfied smile: “No missiles. The boy must remain alive. Dispose of the girl and the brute.”</p>
        <p>The minigun on the mech’s shoulder let out a hellish mechanical whine—spinning up as it aimed at Royce. A split second later, a stream of tracers tore through the night.</p>
        <p>Royce was ready. He instantly activated the shields on his gloves and dove for cover around the building’s corner. Trying to block a heavy machine gun with a handheld field was like using a manhole cover as a shield—nearly impossible to hold steady. And indeed, one of the bullets that hit the field around Royce’s left arm ricocheted off and caught him in the thigh just as he reached the corner. He went down with a cry, but still managed to roll himself behind the wall.</p>
        <p>Max was already moving. He hurled himself aside, trying to draw the gunfire toward him. As he leaped, he activated the protective shield on his belt. However, the machine gun abruptly cut off.</p>
        <p>Lis was on the move too. She made a precise, arcing jump—circling like a hunting cat, forcing the pilot to split his attention. The mech tried to pivot toward her, but Max was faster. He fired the booster in his legs and launched himself upward.</p>
        <p>Too early. The blade in his hand flashed as he slashed at the moving hulk—but the angle was poor. The sword sliced through the metal shell without resistance, but not deep enough to hit anything critical. In the next instant, the giant’s leg swung out, brushing Max aside. It wasn’t a direct hit—more of a shove—but it sent him flying.</p>
        <p>Max lost his balance and crashed onto his back. He didn’t even have time to scramble up—a shadow fell over him like a descending curtain. One massive metal foot hung above him, inexorably coming down. The iron plate, as broad as a truck’s hood, was about to crush him. Max frantically pulled in his legs and triggered the last resort on his belt: an impenetrable spherical field.</p>
        <p>The field flashed and instantly enclosed him—a perfect dome under which the air hummed like a sealed capsule. Even the chunk of asphalt beneath him was encapsulated. He was alive. But the iron foot came down—and began to press.</p>
        <p>An unbearable screech of tortured metal filled the air as the mech’s foot, unable to pierce the field, bore down with its full weight. The ground beneath the dome started sinking under the pressure. The field held. But for how long? Only as long as its battery lasted—and at this output, that wouldn’t be very long at all.</p>
        <p>The leg pressed down again. And at that moment, a shout rang out:</p>
        <p>“Hey, bootleg chicken walker!” Lis hollered. “Did you forget who you’re crushing? You were ordered to keep him alive! Now try to hit <i>me!</i>”</p>
        <p>And she went into a jump. She leaped as only she could—soaring up to kick off the building’s wall. But the booster in her boot heel chose that moment to betray her.</p>
        <p>The jump didn’t go as planned; she barely managed to push off the wall before gravity yanked her down. She landed hard—her leg buckled, and pain lanced through her ankle. Lis grimaced, tried to sidestep—and dropped to one knee.</p>
        <p>The pilot saw it. The mech’s “right arm” swiveled, the machine gun barrel now training on Lis.</p>
        <p>Max saw all of this through the wavering distortion of his field. He saw Lis stumble for just an instant. Saw the barrel swing toward her. She was too far away to dodge.</p>
        <p>He stopped thinking about escaping his own trap. Lis was in danger. He shut down his field with a sharp click. Air rushed back in. Max heaved himself up, firing the boosters in his boots. Pain from his wounded thigh knifed through him at the sudden movement, but he shot out from under the mech’s foot—propelled by nothing but fury.</p>
        <p>A leap. Max raised his sword and cranked the regulator to its maximum setting. <i>Click</i>—the blade flared, extending to triple its length, and the hilt spat sparks as it overloaded. He gripped it hard, the skin of his palm burning as the battery overheated almost instantly.</p>
        <p>He struck. The overextended blade sliced through the machine gun turret’s mounting. Metal shrieked, and the turret jolted, then tore free with a clang, crashing to the ground.</p>
        <p>Max ripped the blade out. A second later, the sword in his hand flickered and died. He froze, chest heaving, the now-useless hilt clenched in his scorched fingers.</p>
        <p>He activated his jump generators, and with one mighty bound landed on the mech’s hull. Clinging to the monster’s armor with his attractor fields, he began to climb toward the cockpit. The pilot was behind thick glass—likely armored. Max got within half a meter of it, but his blade-sword was dead. How to get him out? A repulsive blast might reach through, but it would be too weak.</p>
        <p>An attracting field, then! Max thrust out his hands—an invisible yank dragged the pilot violently against his harness. Still holding that pull, Max kicked off the cockpit with both feet, slamming the pilot against the inside of the reinforced glass.</p>
        <p>The exo-armor shuddered and fell still. The pilot was out cold. The giant, now mindless without its operator, stood frozen.</p>
        <p>Max, panting, stood atop the mech’s hull and looked over the battlefield. Lis was limping toward him—hurt, but holding herself tall. Her eyes were shining. “Don’t think you’re the hero now,” she said, trying to sound tart. “You just happened to be between me and that machine gun at the right time.”</p>
        <p>Royce emerged from behind the building as well, also limping. This battle was over, but the war was far from over.</p>
        <p>Yet Steiner did not look defeated. On the contrary—his face was calm, and his eyes burned with an almost ecstatic light, as if he still held an ace up his sleeve. “Excellent!” he announced, voice even and confident. “I was sure that after witnessing your little toys in action, Project A-17 could be shut down. You have no idea how much useful material our corporation’s specialists have captured on camera today.”</p>
        <p>His calmness was chilling. Even with all his soldiers down, not a flicker of fear crossed his face. He stood utterly at ease, alone against the people who had wiped out his fighters. Max felt a heavy menace hanging in the air. Clearly, Steiner hadn’t staked everything on his troops.</p>
        <p>Max went on full alert. Even before he saw it, some sixth sense confirmed his worst fear: a blade-sword appeared in Steiner’s hand. In comparison, every other threat faded away. This was the true danger.</p>
        <p>“Professor…” Max whispered, a tremor of dread in his voice. “They broke him…”</p>
        <p>From Steiner’s stance, Max knew they had no chance. Steiner was a professional. No flamboyant moves, no mistakes. He was the kind of opponent you didn’t fight if you wanted to live—Max remembered that from Master Yamaguchi’s lessons. At least now he understood the scale of what he faced.</p>
        <p>Lis tried to jump back, but with dead boosters her attempt faltered, almost comically. Max glanced at her and realized her batteries were spent. He sighed heavily. “I warned you to conserve your energy, not to jump around so much…” he muttered, mostly to himself. Then, louder and firm: “Run. I’ll distract him.” There was something in his tone that brooked no argument.</p>
        <p>“No!” Lis snapped, tense and ready to argue. But Max, seeing her waver, added, “Do you want your father dragged back into their hands?” He spoke calmly, but those words carried the full weight and bitterness of their past. Lis froze, her expression shifting, and finally she nodded—understanding that her place was not here.</p>
        <p>She was about to leave, but suddenly she whirled back and gave him that signature deep gaze of hers—the kind a man could drown in. “I believe in you, <i>My Hero!</i>” she said fiercely.</p>
        <p>Steiner observed this impassively, paying no attention to Lis or Royce. He could round up those two rats later. His focus was solely on Max.</p>
        <p>“I have orders to bring you in alive…” Steiner said, his voice turning even colder and more deadly. “But no one said anything about your legs.”</p>
        <p>Lis and Royce, along with the former captives from the facility, retreated into the shadows, leaving Max and Steiner one-on-one. For Max, a true dance of death was about to begin. Steiner was older, more experienced, and his weapon was already in hand…</p>
        <p>Max felt it in his gut—this opponent was lethally dangerous, and Steiner’s equipment was on par with his own (except that Max’s blade-sword was no longer functioning). But Max’s primary goal now was to buy as much time as possible for Lis and Royce to get clear. All he needed to do was put on a convincing show of fighting Steiner, then look for a chance to escape. The key was giving Lis that time.</p>
        <p>He darted around the courtyard, feinting attacks at Steiner with repulsive field blasts. But each of Max’s jumps grew clumsier, and he felt his strength draining away. He poured every drop of energy into speed, but Steiner was too good.</p>
        <p>Steiner didn’t even bother to pursue. He stayed in place, watching Max’s frantic maneuvers calmly, as if he already knew exactly how this would end. And at the moment Max tried to reactivate the blade on his right bracer to slash at him, Steiner coolly raised a shield on his left arm. Max struck hard, but the blow rebounded off the protective field without a sound.</p>
        <p>Steiner wasted no time countering—his blade-sword sheared through Max’s bracer and sliced into his forearm. Max recoiled, blood dripping onto the sand, his movements slowing. A triumphant smile spread across Steiner’s face.</p>
        <p>Max understood he could no longer attack. His right bracer was destroyed, and his right arm was injured. He kept dodging, but his moves were growing sloppy, and each jump was shorter than the last. He knew it was time to run; even his strongest field wouldn’t save him now. Max vaulted over the fence, hoping to lose Steiner in the grove beyond, but Steiner was already there—a dark shadow at his heels. Steiner’s armor boosters ensured Max couldn’t shake him.</p>
        <p>Max stumbled, tumbled, and fell, gasping for breath. His strength was abandoning him. Steiner approached at an unhurried stroll, his voice dripping with mockery. “Anything else to say? While you’re still conscious?” he asked, a wicked grin twisting his face.</p>
        <p>Max, struggling up on one elbow, caught sight of a shadow in his peripheral vision—something moving at the edge of his field of view. Instinct told him it wasn’t just his vision blurring; it was something <i>familiar</i>. He managed to gasp out, “You… you should’ve worn a helmet.”</p>
        <p>A heartbeat later, Steiner grasped the meaning of Max’s words—right as his head separated from his body, his armored corpse left standing upright by its exoskeleton. Behind him stood Master Yamaguchi, utterly composed. In a cold, steady voice, he said, “Pull yourself together. It’s time to go. Do you hear the helicopters?”</p>
        <p>Max surveyed the battlefield. In the distance, the sound of approaching helicopters was growing—meaning they had to move, now.</p>
        <p>“First, I need to collect some trophies,” Max said. He strode over to Steiner’s body and pried Steiner’s blade-sword and shield from the lifeless hands. These would be useful for analysis—but not right now.</p>
        <p>“I’ll have to study these, but…” Max’s movements slowed; the weight of everything that had happened was finally sinking in. “I’m afraid our war is already lost. The Professor is with them.”</p>
        <p>Despite being rescued, Max couldn’t shake the sense of defeat. He understood the situation was turning against them.</p>
        <p>“A war is only lost when people stop fighting,” Yamaguchi said quietly, as if reminding him that defeat is only a choice. There was no pity in his tone, only calm philosophy.</p>
        <p>Max nodded. “You’re right,” he murmured. “A war is only lost when people stop fighting.” With that realization, he straightened and turned to Yamaguchi. “The helicopters will be flying all night…”</p>
