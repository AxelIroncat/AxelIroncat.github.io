        <h1>Chapter 33. Preparation</h1>

        <p>It was late. The dim hum of the generator merged with quiet voices by the screen where Lis and Royce hunched over a schematic of the correctional facility. They kept circling back to entry points, fallback routes, extraction timing — but Max wasn’t listening.</p>
        <p>He sat apart, hunched forward, cradling the blade in his hand.</p>
        <p>At a glance, it was just a weapon. But to him, it wasn’t. His awareness seemed to stretch toward it — not physically, not mentally, but as if his very perception bent around it. Like the blade vibrated on some frequency beyond touch or sight. As though the world didn’t stop at five senses. Or six. There was a seventh. And this blade was singing to it.</p>
        <p>“Max.”</p>
        <p>Lawrence’s voice snapped him halfway back to the room.</p>
        <p>“You zoning out on us now?” Adam stepped closer, arms already folded.</p>
        <p>“We’ve gone over this plan a hundred times,” Max said, eyes still locked on the blade. “It’s not going to go that way anyway. It never does.”</p>
        <p>Adam smirked. “So you’re putting all your faith in your toys?”</p>
        <p>“They haven’t failed me yet.”</p>
        <p>“They haven’t been tested like this yet.” Lawrence’s voice cooled. “Before, the corporation wasn’t ready. Now they are. They know you exist. They know what you can do. And believe me — they’ll be ready. They don’t send amateurs.”</p>
        <p>Max shrugged. “Alright. So what do we do?”</p>
        <p>“We train. We prepare. And I’d still put my money on an old man with a sword over your tech.”</p>
        <p>“You don’t get how these fields work.” Max traced the edge of his weapon with a fingertip. “If my blade even brushes his, it shortens it. And if I’ve got my shield up, his can’t even touch me.”</p>
        <p>A new voice broke in. Calm. Crisp.</p>
        <p>“Would you like to test that?”</p>
        <p>Max looked up.</p>
        <p>Master Yamaguchi had been sitting silently in the shadows, watching. Now he stood with perfect stillness, a hint of a smile flickering like light on water.</p>
        <p>“You can’t attack and defend at the same time,” the Master said gently.</p>
        <p>Max’s smirk twisted across his face — a reflex of deflection, a half-mask to hide the growing edge of tension. “Every time I’ve had to hurt someone, it hurt me too. Not just physically. This thing... it’s too dangerous if I don’t control it perfectly. I can’t afford to cut you. And I can’t afford to fail if you’re counting on me.”</p>
        <p>“Afraid to spar?” Lawrence goaded, arching a brow.</p>
        <p>“It’s not fear,” Max muttered. “It’s calculation.”</p>
        <p>“You’re heading into a real fight,” Adam said. “And you’re hesitating at a training match?”</p>
        <p>Max’s jaw clenched. Then he stood, slowly.</p>
        <p>“Fine. You want a demonstration? You’ll get one. But I warned you.”</p>
        <p>He stepped into the open space, rolling his shoulders loose. The blade in his grip shimmered — a whisper of power barely caged.</p>
        <p>Yamaguchi rose, unhurried. He moved like water finds its shape. No stiffness, no hesitation — only flow. He stepped into position, raised his katana. The stance was simple. Flawless.</p>
        <p>Max eyed the sword and nodded toward it.</p>
        <p>“You’re not worried about that thing getting nicked?”</p>
        <p>“That blade belonged to my ancestors.” The Master’s voice was calm. “Their spirits live in its edge.”</p>
        <p>Max tilted his head. “Seriously?”</p>
        <p>The Master smiled faintly. “Belief is optional. The edge is not.”</p>
        <p>“Alright then.”</p>
        <p>Max moved fast.</p>
        <p>He didn’t aim for anything critical. Just a clean slice across the tip — a proof of concept. The blade-knife in his hand was nearly weightless, its energy field sharper than thought. But before he could finish the motion—</p>
        <p>The katana wasn’t where it had been.</p>
        <p>Max blinked. Then frowned.</p>
        <p>Impossible.</p>
        <p>Yamaguchi hadn’t moved fast — he’d moved… elsewhere. Like he had never been where Max was looking to begin with.</p>
        <p>Max’s pride crackled — clean, sharp. He felt it like ice sliding down his spine. This wasn’t just defeat.</p>
        <p>This was education.</p>
        <p>He struck again, faster this time. The Master’s katana didn’t block. It evaded — gliding past Max’s field, never quite touching, never quite allowing the clash. Every move Max made hit nothing. Every angle was wrong by a fraction. The Master was already gone — no resistance, no effort, just air where a body had been.</p>
        <p>Max gritted his teeth and increased his speed, trying to pin him. For a brief moment, he was sure he had him.</p>
        <p>He lunged.</p>
        <p>A chill touched his throat.</p>
        <p>He froze.</p>
        <p>The katana rested lightly across his neck. Yamaguchi stood behind him, still as moonlight.</p>
        <p>Max didn’t breathe. The realization sank like stone — his field, his sensors, his instincts — all bypassed. His so-called seventh sense hadn’t failed.</p>
        <p>He simply didn’t understand it.</p>
        <p>“Your mind searched for me,” the Master said softly, “in the place where thoughts live. But I was not there. In combat, you think too much, Max. And that thinking slows your blade. Slows your eyes. Slows you.”</p>
        <p>Max exhaled sharply. His lungs felt like stone.</p>
        <p>He turned.</p>
        <p>“Again,” he said, quieter now. No longer with defiance — but with hunger.</p>
        <p>Yamaguchi nodded.</p>
        <p>This time Max moved with focus. Slower. Watching. Trying to predict. But the harder he watched, the more the Master dissolved. He didn’t block, he didn’t counter — he simply flowed.</p>
        <p>Max activated his shield.</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>No strike came.</p>
        <p>He attacked. Nothing.</p>
        <p>Tried a pulse strike. Missed.</p>
        <p>Tried leap compression — overshot.</p>
        <p>Every time he moved, the Master simply wasn’t there.</p>
        <p>It was as if the space around him obeyed different laws.</p>
        <p>Max staggered back, panting.</p>
        <p>“What the hell is this?” he muttered.</p>
        <p>Yamaguchi gave him only a slight smile.</p>
        <p>“You rely on tools. On force. But it’s not the blade that wins the fight — it’s what wields the blade. The intent. The emptiness behind form.”</p>
        <p>Max just stood there. Everything inside him — pride, certainty, even his grief — was cracking. His technology was brilliant. But it wasn’t enough.</p>
        <p>Not here.</p>
        <p>From the couch behind him came laughter.</p>
        <p>He turned.</p>
        <p>Royce and Lis sat watching like theatergoers, both grinning. Royce's laugh was open and bright, but Lis… Lis just smiled — slow, sly, like she’d seen this a hundred times in different lives.</p>
        <p>“That was… enlightening,” she said, her tone perfectly even, but her eyes gleamed with something sharper.</p>
        <p>“Yeah,” Royce chuckled. “You got owned. But it looked amazing.”</p>
        <p>Max wiped sweat from his brow. “Glad someone’s entertained.”</p>
        <p>Lawrence stepped forward, arms crossed. “Now do you get it?”</p>
        <p>Max stared at his blade, still warm in his palm.</p>
        <p>“I get it,” he said. “So what now?”</p>
        <p>“You master it,” Adam replied. “Lucky for you, we’ve got someone who can teach.”</p>
        <p>Yamaguchi studied Max quietly.</p>
        <p>“Your blade is too light for katana form,” he said. “But it reminds me of a wakizashi. Quick. Restless. It seeks its own rhythm.”</p>
        <p>“And what does that mean for me?”</p>
        <p>The Master allowed the faintest grin.</p>
        <p>“It means you’ll start with a kodachi-bokken.”</p>
        <p>Max arched a brow. “A training sword?”</p>
        <p>“Without form, there is no freedom,” the Master replied. “No control. No precision.”</p>
        <p>Max looked to Lawrence.</p>
        <p>Adam shrugged. “You’ve seen it yourself. Your toys aren’t invincible. Might be time to learn something new.”</p>
        <p>Max hesitated. Then looked at his blade one last time, and nodded.</p>
        <p>The blade still hummed with latent power.</p>
        <p>But somewhere beneath the hum was silence — the kind you had to learn to hear.</p>
        <p>“How did you know where I’d strike?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Yamaguchi slowly slid the katana back into its sheath.</p>
        <p>“You were watching my sword,” he said. “But a sword doesn’t choose. A sword doesn’t think.”</p>
        <p>He touched two fingers to his own eyes.</p>
        <p>“Intent lives here, Max. Not in the hands. Not in the steel. It’s born behind the gaze — long before a body moves. You can train your limbs. Mask your breath. But the eyes give you away.”</p>
        <p>Max stared at him.</p>
        <p>“So… you were reading me before I even made the choice?”</p>
        <p>The Master nodded once.</p>
        <p>“A true warrior sees not the form, but the space around it. Not the strike, but the stillness before it. Power is born in that silence — before motion. Before thought. That’s the place we fight from.”</p>
        <p>He stepped back, his voice soft:</p>
        <p>“It’s called mushin. No mind. No fear. No intention. Just action.”</p>
        <p>Max exhaled.</p>
        <p>Lis leaned in with a smirk. “So, genius, finally accepting that gadgets don’t replace training?”</p>
        <p>Royce added with a laugh: “Bad news, bro. You can’t upgrade your eyes.”</p>
        <p>Max raked a hand through his hair — a gesture of grudging acceptance, and of something new taking root.</p>
        <p>“Alright,” he said. “When do we start?”</p>
        <p>Yamaguchi gave a quiet, unreadable smile.</p>
        <p>“With the first light,” he said. “Only then is the mind clear enough to begin.”</p>
        <p>He turned.</p>
        <p>Max stood still, eyes on the floor.</p>
        <p>Then he looked up.</p>
        <p>And followed.</p>
