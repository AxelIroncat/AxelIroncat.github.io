        <h1>Chapter 2. The Formula of Power</h1>
        <p>Max stepped into the room following Professor Blinov.</p>
        <p>The warm air was permeated with the tart aroma of black tea, old books, and a faint hint of dust.</p>
        <p>Oval armchairs around a slightly worn table created a sense of intimate coziness – a place where people who had known each other for years had gathered for many years.</p>
        <p>A large screen hung on the wall in the corner, silently broadcasting news.</p>
        <p>Four professors sat at the table – faces familiar to Max, before whom he had once taken exams and defended course papers.</p>
        <p>"Colleagues," Professor Blinov said calmly, stopping at the table, "allow me to introduce my assistant, Maxim."</p>
        <p>The conversations quieted for a moment: for a few seconds, everyone just looked at him. The tall, dark-skinned Laurent Vignion was the first to break the silence.</p>
        <p>His deep voice, with a slight French accent, sounded playful and mocking.</p>
        <p>"Maxim," he drawled with a barely perceptible irony, narrowing his shrewd eyes.</p>
        <p>He wore a slightly worn gray jacket, whose shoulders had already begun to droop with age. "Now I feel old. I remember you as a daring student: quite a boy — ambitious, self-confident, and, unfortunately, right in all your arguments."</p>
        <p>Max nodded slightly, trying to suppress his excitement:</p>
        <p>"Thank you."</p>
        <p>Tkach chuckled loudly nearby.</p>
        <p>His massive figure in a dark shirt and broad shoulders with silver stubble seemed the embodiment of reliable strength.</p>
        <p>He leaned heavily on the table:</p>
        <p>"You still maintain a high standard," Tkach said in an even, but confident voice.</p>
        <p>"With such potential, I honestly thought you'd go into a corporation. In a couple of years, you'd make a career better than any of ours…"</p>
        <p>"Not immediately," Anna Morozova interrupted him. In her slender figure, in the delicate features of her face behind transparent glasses, a nervous energy was discernible: her hands, adorned with an elegant ring, held the cup.</p>
        <p>"However, I agree: you had potential. We were even surprised that you decided to stay here."</p>
        <p>Max felt the slight tension in his shoulders give way to steady confidence.</p>
        <p>"Staying here is a conscious choice," he replied, smiling slightly. "I know I still have much to learn."</p>
        <p>"And the right one," Blinov confirmed curtly. "I've been observing him for a long time. Now he is where he should be."</p>
        <p>Vignion raised his teacup in a light toast:</p>
        <p>"Then welcome," he said.</p>
        <p>"You are now in our small, capricious, eternally debating circle. Have a seat."</p>
        <p>Max took the vacant seat by the window. In the soft twilight of the room, cups clinked merrily against saucers, and the invigorating aroma of strong tea wafted through the air. The conversation flowed again, but no longer as between a student and professors, but as among colleagues: someone told stories from their postgraduate years, someone discussed recent seminars, someone simply remained silent in pleasant contemplation. A slight confusion stirred in his chest – he was sitting at the same table with these respected scientists for the first time not as a student, but as a conversationalist, though he had not yet uttered a word.</p>
        <p>At that moment, the screen on the wall suddenly came alive. Anna Morozova instinctively raised her head, frowning.</p>
        <p>"Something urgent…" she murmured, without lifting her cup. Her fingers reached for the remote and pressed a button. The voice in the room immediately grew louder.</p>
        <p>A black background appeared on the screen with large letters: "Urgent Statement from 'Kairo' Corporation." The conversation died down. Tkach put down his cup, Vignion leaned forward, as if trying to see the image from a new angle. His eyes reflected the screen's glare.</p>
        <p>Urgent Statement from 'Kairo' Corporation.</p>
        <p>She appeared on the screen. She didn't walk to the podium, didn't look around — she was already standing there. As if her presence preceded everything, and now the world had only to follow her shadow… Almost motionless, perfectly poised. Dark hair, without a single strand out of place, flowed from the perfect silhouette of her concise suit. No accessories, no jewelry, no flaws. For a moment, Max felt his heart stop: there was something elusive about her — neither mere beauty nor visible strength, but a perfect singularity, bordering on something unnatural. It seemed as if she was not born, but designed. Every feature obeyed some inaccessible algorithm.</p>
        <p>At some point, he imagined her dark eyes looking directly into the lens, and then — as if directly at him. As if she knew that he was here, in this corner of the world. As if she had already decided what role the future would assign him. Max gripped his cup tighter.</p>
        <p>The scrolling ticker displayed the text: "Iris Tanaka, Chairwoman of the Board of 'Kairo' Corporation." Composed down to the last detail, in a strict, patternless suit, with perfect makeup, she spoke in an even, calm voice. Her tone was soft, yet every word seemed to settle precisely into place, brooking no objection.</p>
        <p>"Over the past decades, 'Kairo' Corporation has become a key element of the technological and economic infrastructure in many countries," her voice carried over all the silent faces. "We support critically important processes: from logistics and medical networks to neuro-analytics, distributed computing, and decision-making systems. We don't just maintain infrastructure — we help it develop, synchronize, adapt to changing conditions. Today, I can confidently say: we are entering a new phase. The research cycle, initiated under my father, has reached maturity. A series of key experiments in neuro-engineering have been completed: the first generation of implants capable of significantly increasing cognitive processing efficiency is ready for implementation. This is direct support for those who daily face complex decisions in conditions of high uncertainty. And this is just the first step towards a deeper architecture of human-system interaction."</p>
        <p>She continued, slowly and carefully emphasizing: adaptive neuroplasticity, extension of the active period of life, increased resistance to age-related changes. "These are very sensitive areas," she said, "each new technology requires careful, conscious implementation. But we are confident: we are moving in the right direction."</p>
        <p>"Tests of new generation mobile exobody complexes with neuro-amplifiers have been completed." — Iris's voice remained even. "A network of tactical support drones, integrated into a scalable complex, has also been deployed. Soon, in a number of cities, 'Kairo' security service will work in close conjunction with municipal structures, patrolling the streets and ensuring response to emergency situations."</p>
        <p>She nodded at the camera and concluded:</p>
        <p>"This is not a random leap. We are going where stability is needed. Our task is to continue the course that has allowed millions of people to live and work in a more understandable and predictable environment. We are not changing ourselves. We are maturing. The world is changing — and we are already here to make these changes manageable."</p>
        <p>The screen went dark, and a hollow silence fell in the room. For a few seconds, everyone just sat, as if digesting not what they had heard, but what they had seen.</p>
        <p>"Did you notice how she spoke?" Morozova said softly, opening her eyes. "Neither a politician nor a technocrat… More like a flawlessly trained orator. As if she knew: no one would dare to object."</p>
        <p>"And indeed, no one will object," Vignion agreed, narrowing his eyes. "When all logistics, medicine, and energy of the country operate under contract with 'Kairo,' opposing is pointless. Better to just nod."</p>
        <p>Anna frowned and added: "This is no longer a business, but a pillar of the state. And someone allowed her to become so. Not in one day."</p>
        <p>Tkach calmly placed his cup on the table and, without shifting his gaze, said coldly:</p>
        <p>"Or no one forbade it. And rightly so."</p>
        <p>Morozova stared at him, not expecting such bluntness.</p>
        <p>"You mean you're not concerned?"</p>
        <p>"Why should I be concerned?" Tkach shrugged. "Over the past ten years, 'Kairo' has stabilized the transport network, solved energy deficit problems, implemented digital medicine. And now it's taking on security. It's logical: where there is weakness, someone who knows how to act comes. The problem is not that the corporation is strong. The problem is that everyone else is weak."</p>
        <p>"You are justifying the private redistribution of power," Morozova grumbled. "They patrol the streets, manage chips in bodies, command drone fleets. This is a direct monopoly on force. Without elections, without restrictions."</p>
        <p>Tkach shrugged again:</p>
        <p>"Yes," he agreed. "But there are results. The streets are safer, medicine works faster, infrastructure functions without glitches. Maybe we just don't like that someone does the job better than the state. But that doesn't make it 'bad'."</p>
        <p>"As long as goals align," Vignion interjected. "As long as interests don't diverge. You speak like an engineer, not a historian. All systems of power first bring benefit — and only then begin to establish their own rules."</p>
        <p>"Or we are observing evolution," Tkach argued. "The world is becoming more complex, hierarchies are changing, classical institutions cannot keep up with the speed. Those who are adapted to the new world come to their place. It's natural selection — nothing personal."</p>
        <p>"Nothing personal?" Morozova repeated. "And when you are told that your teaching license will be reviewed based on a 'cognitive efficiency coefficient for the corporation,' will you also say it's natural selection?"</p>
        <p>Max closed his eyes. He listened attentively to all this, as if a current, exposing the essence, penetrated his consciousness. Deep down, he felt: a turning point was brewing in the air. Something important was about to happen.</p>
        <p>At that moment, Professor Blinov, unhurriedly, placed his cup on the table and spoke quietly. Not a word was uttered in the room – everyone felt they should remain silent.</p>
        <p>"You know, colleagues… We always talk about power as if it's somewhere outside," he began quietly, but every word cut through the air. "As if it falls from above, descends from the sky, or appears by chance. In reality, it is something internal, inevitable. Power never falls suddenly. It merely redistributes itself."</p>
        <p>He slowly stood up and, without taking his eyes off the inner space, walked along the window. Behind him, the realization of what had been said seemed to flow.</p>
        <p>"We call our society democratic. We talk about elections, rights, equality. But essentially… democracy is a historical anomaly, a brief period when the balance of power was accessible not only to the chosen few.</p>
        <p>The teachers exchanged glances.</p>
        <p>"And do you know when this began?" Blinov continued, not looking at anyone in particular. "When gunpowder came into use. When any peasant with a primitive rifle could suddenly kill a knight in expensive armor, who was raised and fed at state expense. Then equality became a matter not of status, but of instrument, and power for the first time became vulnerable from below."</p>
        <p>Morozova nodded, as if repeating a long-held thought: "A rifle gave the citizen political weight. From it, man as a subject of history began."</p>
        <p>"And now," Blinov continued, "we are observing the opposite. Exosuits, drones, artificial intelligence. All of this is not democratic weaponry. It's not something you can just buy in a store or create in a shed. These are complex technologies requiring access, capital, infrastructure. It's a return to monopoly — only not feudal, but corporate."</p>
        <p>"So the circle has closed," Vignion concluded. "Again, power is where force is accessible only to those who can afford it."</p>
        <p>"Yes," Blinov nodded. "And most importantly: all this happens quietly. Not through war, but through development. People applaud, sign licensing agreements, check boxes under user terms — and surrender everything, including the right to force, without a fight."</p>
        <p>Max listened intently. It seemed as if the professor's words stripped away everything superfluous, leaving only the bare structure of the world — with its nodes of power and flows of influence.</p>
        <p>"So," Tkach suddenly asked, "are we witnessing the death of democracy?"</p>
        <p>"Not death," Blinov replied calmly. "It's the exhaustion of a phase. Power changes form, but its essence remains the same: it is where there are opportunities, resources, control. And now – where there is technology."</p>
        <p>In this pause, no one dared to say a word. Tkach gazed thoughtfully into his empty cup.</p>
        <p>"You are always right, Vladislav Mikhailovich," he said after a moment, quietly and respectfully. "Only know this… Historically, no state was created for the benefit of the people. We invented beautiful words later. But originally, power is force. Whoever has the sword makes the law. The state is merely the most successful gang that managed to legalize its dominance."</p>
        <p>Morozova added:</p>
        <p>"And now the sword has been replaced by drones, implants, surveillance systems," She smiled slightly, but there was no irony in this smile — only a tense, anxious clarity. "Basically, it's all the same. Only the interface is different."</p>
        <p>"Initially, everyone is happy," Vignion added. "There is order, medicine works, crime is lower. But we know: this is always just a stage. Before something new."</p>
        <p>Max looked away into his cup and suddenly spoke quietly:</p>
        <p>"Excuse me… maybe it's out of place… but you seem to have almost derived the formula."</p>
        <p>Everyone instantly turned to him. He flushed and fell silent, but then continued resolutely:</p>
        <p>"Power is based on force. Force can be bought with money. Money is multiplied through power. It creates a cycle — money, force, power… and then money again."</p>
        <p>For a few seconds, there was a deathly silence in the room. Then Tkach nodded:</p>
        <p>"A good approximation."</p>
        <p>"But not complete," Morozova interjected thoughtfully. "What about belief?"</p>
        <p>"Religious belief?" Vignion clarified, smiling slightly.</p>
        <p>"And not just religion," Morozova explained. "People obey not only because they can be forced. They obey when they believe that the one before them has the right to command. When they believe that he knows better, leads where needed, or is simply stronger."</p>
        <p>"Agreed," Tkach said quietly. "Belief — that is the force that works even without weapons. It's harder to buy, but if it exists — it can replace everything else."</p>
        <p>"And vice versa," Blinov added. "Loss of belief can collapse even absolute power."</p>
        <p>Anna suddenly smiled at the corners of her lips:</p>
        <p>"And even in nature, it's essentially the same. Before a fight, a cat arches its back to appear larger. It doesn't become stronger itself — but the opponent believes in its strength and retreats. Everything works on perception."</p>
        <p>"The Romans attached long crests to their helmets," Vignion added. "To appear taller, to instill fear. As soon as the enemy believes you are stronger, you can consider yourself victorious."</p>
        <p>Tkach took a deep breath and, without taking his eyes off the empty cup, again said quietly:</p>
        <p>"So, we have a cycle. Money gives force. Force allows power to be asserted. And power, in turn, opens access to new money."</p>
        <p>Morozova nodded:</p>
        <p>"A closed system. Self-reinforcing. The more resources — the stronger the control. The stronger the control — the more resources."</p>
        <p>"And all this rests on belief," Vignion concluded, smiling faintly. "People obey not only because they can be forced. They obey when they believe that the one before them has the right to give orders. Or at least looks that way."</p>
        <p>Slowly, Blinov pushed his cup aside and wiped his hands with a napkin. Then, as if performing a small ritual, he unfolded it in front of him. He opened a small case lying nearby and took out an ink pen. Max couldn't take his eyes off him: the professor seemed to slow his movements, awaiting the moment.</p>
        <p>"You speak of force," he said calmly, raising his head, "but force itself doesn't appear out of nowhere. It must have a foundation."</p>
        <p>He lowered the black shaft of the pen onto the napkin and carefully drew the first arrow.</p>
        <p>"Money gives force."</p>
        <p>The second arrow slipped from under the pen with a soft rustle.</p>
        <p>"Force gives power."</p>
        <p>The third straight line closed the triangle. Blinov leaned back:</p>
        <p>"And power returns money."</p>
        <p>He stood behind the table and, without taking his eyes off the diagram, said firmly:</p>
        <p>M → F → P → M</p>
        <p>"A closed chain," he explained. "The more resources or money (M) you have, the more force (F) you can afford to acquire. The more force, the more power (P). And power, in turn, allows you to retain and multiply resources. This is how any stable empire is structured. And a corporation. And even a cult."</p>
        <p>He made a pause, then below the first drawing, he wrote a larger formula:</p>
        <p>P = F × B</p>
        <p>"And now — the main secret: power is not just force. Power is force multiplied by belief (B)," Blinov said, carefully writing the letters. "And not your belief, but the belief of those who obey you. Their conviction that you are strong. That you have legitimate right."</p>
        <p>Max held his breath, watching the professor complete his diagram.</p>
        <p>"The more they believe in you," he continued, "the less real force is required. And if belief disappears — no force will save you. Because power will stop working."</p>
        <p>The professor put down the pen. On the napkin before him, like the stamp of truth, two formulas shone. Max looked at them and felt scenes from all of human history flicker in his mind — from ancient chiefs to those who govern states and corporations today.</p>
        <p>Tkach, leaning back in his chair, was the first to speak, as if to himself:</p>
        <p>"Today, Iris Tanaka left no one in doubt as to who holds power here."</p>
        <p>In the silence, as if weighted by the realization of what had been said, no one moved. The words seemed to take on flesh: they lived here and now — in the city streets, in people's minds, in their fear and hopes.</p>
        <p>Max said not a word, but felt something akin to delight growing in his chest — a quiet, deep, almost sacred delight, like touching knowledge that could neither be forgotten nor betrayed. He felt that he was in the right place, at the right time, where he could understand much and learn much. His life seemed to be unfolding very fortunately.</p>
        <p>When the arguing professors began to disperse, the napkin with the formulas — forgotten by all — remained on the table. Max smiled almost imperceptibly. He carefully picked up the sheet, folded it twice, as if guarding a secret, and put it in his pocket. There was no telling when all this wisdom would be needed again, but something told him: this knowledge would be a guiding thread even in the darkest hour.</p>
