        <h1>Chapter 32. Good Boy</h1>

        <p>He slipped back into the dark.</p>
        <p>Not sleep — <i>oblivion</i> .Pain had rooted itself deep in his nerves, spreading outward like frostbite, dragging him down into something thick and endless.No shape. No sound.Only cold.</p>
        <p>Time no longer passed. His body no longer mattered.There was nothing left to feel.</p>
        <p>Until —</p>
        <p>A spark.A voice.</p>
        <p>Soft. Hypnotic.Like music drifting through a wall, just faint enough to feel imagined.</p>
        <p><i>Her</i> voice.</p>
        <p>Consciousness slammed back into him like a heartbeat returning from flatline.</p>
        <p>And there she was.The face.</p>
        <p>The most beautiful face in the world.</p>
        <p>Perfect symmetry.Unsmiling lips — too flawless to be human.Eyes sharp and still and <i>inhumanly calm</i> .Like polished obsidian that had never known warmth.</p>
        <p>She spoke.</p>
        <p>“Someone damaged my people…”</p>
        <p>Her voice flowed like silk across broken glass — delicate, terrifying in its control.</p>
        <p>“They were wearing the most advanced armor we’ve ever developed. And still… they lost.Which means someone out there has something dangerous.A weapon that should not exist.”</p>
        <p>She tilted her head, just slightly — the motion effortless, elegant, <i>predatory</i> .</p>
        <p>“And you, Professor…Surely you know what it is.”</p>
        <p>He tried to speak.His lips cracked. His throat was desert-dry.</p>
        <p>But he forced the words out anyway.</p>
        <p>“I… know nothing.”</p>
        <p>She didn’t blink.</p>
        <p>“Ah. Professor.”</p>
        <p>Her voice didn’t rise, but it dropped a degree — enough for disappointment to curl around the syllables like a fine mist.</p>
        <p>He inhaled with effort, breath catching against the pain.</p>
        <p>“I’ve lived long enough,” he said.“Just kill me.”</p>
        <p>She laughed.</p>
        <p>Not loud. Not cruel.A low, affectionate sound — the kind a mother makes when a child says something adorably naïve.</p>
        <p>“Oh, my sweet…”</p>
        <p>She leaned in, and her gloved fingers ghosted across his face.Along the sharp lines of his jaw.Through the tangles of his sweat-matted gray hair.</p>
        <p>“I’m not going to let you die.”</p>
        <p>She was close enough now that he could feel her breath at his ear.Cool. Calm. Measured.</p>
        <p>“There’s an entire medical staff here to make sure you don’t die. Not from pain. Not from exhaustion.Not even from despair.”</p>
        <p>“I’m taking care of you.”</p>
        <p>Her fingers kept moving — tender, exact, and terrifying.As if she were petting a pet she loved.Or a machine she owned.</p>
        <p>“All you have to do is be…a good boy.”</p>
        <p>He squeezed his eyes shut.</p>
        <p>Her voice didn’t just <i>speak</i> anymore — it <i>inhabited</i> him. Slipped between thoughts. Took root.</p>
        <p>He swallowed.</p>
        <p>“Why…?” His voice was weak. But not trembling.“Why do you want so much power? Why take people’s freedom?”</p>
        <p>She smiled — not cruelly. Not kindly. Just… <i>knowingly</i> .</p>
        <p>“Oh, little fool.Freedom is a fairytale.”</p>
        <p>“People have never been free.They’re ruled by hunger. By comfort. By chemicals in their blood.By gravity.They think they’re choosing — but they’re not.”</p>
        <p>She straightened slightly. Her shadow stretched across his chest like a blade.</p>
        <p>“Power isn’t the opposite of freedom.It’s its replacement.”</p>
        <p>“Every social creature needs a leader.Without one, a pack disintegrates. It scatters. It dies.Humans are just a bigger, messier pack.And when power is weak, chaos creeps in.War. Plague. Collapse.So they give up their freedom — willingly — because they’re terrified of what comes without it.”</p>
        <p>He looked at her, eyes aching, lips split.</p>
        <p>“But who gave you the right to claim that power?”</p>
        <p>“Natural selection.”</p>
        <p>It was almost gentle. A whisper of fact.Like gravity didn’t <i>need</i> to be right. It just <i>was</i> .</p>
        <p>“Efficiency,” she added. “That’s all this world rewards.And there’s nothing more efficient than a corporation.Why pretend otherwise? Why cling to myths, when the machine works?”</p>
        <p>“People should have the right to choose.”</p>
        <p>“To choose what?”</p>
        <p>She stroked his hair again, smiling like a parent watching a child still believing in magic.</p>
        <p>“To waste their lives?To chase dreams that will never matter?To <i>fail</i> , over and over, for the sake of some sacred illusion?”</p>
        <p>Her voice softened further, now velvet — now poison.</p>
        <p>“We set limits for children, so they don’t hurt themselves.Adults…aren’t so different.They <i>want</i> to be led.It’s not oppression.It’s evolution.”</p>
        <p>“But what makes <i>you</i> the one who gets to decide for them?”</p>
        <p>She tilted her head again. Something flickered in her gaze — something he hadn’t expected.</p>
        <p>Not anger. Not cruelty.But genuine surprise.</p>
        <p>“Haven’t you figured that out yet…?”</p>
        <p>She didn’t wait for an answer.</p>
        <p>Just turned.</p>
        <p>The motion was seamless. She glided across the room, each step measured like choreography.No drama. No theatrics.</p>
        <p>Only finality.</p>
        <p>He swallowed hard.Something in his chest twisted.</p>
        <p>“No…No, please… not that…”</p>
        <p>She reached the door.</p>
        <p>“Don’t leave me…”</p>
        <p>She paused.</p>
        <p>Just for a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>But she didn’t turn around.And then she walked out.</p>
        <p>The door whispered shut behind her.Like a sentence being sealed.</p>
