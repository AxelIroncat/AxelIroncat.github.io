        <!-- Prologue content paragraphs -->
        <p>The chamber was silent, like a sepulchre. The soft ceiling light didn't so much illuminate as dissolve into the whiteness of the walls. The air was still, as if afraid to disturb a breath. He lay on the couchâ€”not like a man, but like a statue of the past. Beforeâ€”a lion, a sovereign, an architect of power. Nowâ€”a helpless body, surrounded by tubes. His breathing was mechanical, regular, like the sound of a pump in a dungeon. Eyes closed. His faceâ€”silent, yet the veins on his temples still pulsed. An echo of a departed will.</p>
        <p>She stood behind the glass.</p>
        <p>When the door slid open, everything seemed to hold its breath for a moment. Iris entered.</p>
        <p>She wore a black leather dress that fit like cast armor, accentuating her flawless figure. Black hair cascaded over her shoulders like dark silk. High boots emphasized her graceful stride. In every movement, confidence was palpable. And power.</p>
        <p>The family doctor, a middle-aged man, snapped to attention the moment he saw her. He didn't even dare to speak.</p>
        <p>Iris approached her father. For a while, she simply stood, then sat on the edge of the couch and ran her gloved hand over his cheekâ€”almost tenderly, as over a once-cherished object.</p>
        <p>"You always said weakness was defeat," her voice was calm, even soft. "But now you are weak. You lie there, breathing through a tube. You are no longer a lion. You are a legend without claws."</p>
        <p>"You wanted to raise me strong. You just didn't think I'd become stronger than you."</p>
        <p>She leaned close to his ear and whispered: "I won." No triumph. No pity. No hatred. Only completion.</p>
        <p>"I won't kill you. That would be too easy. You will live. In this silence. Without power. Without a name. Until I decide otherwise."</p>
        <p>She stood, cast a final glance, and headed for the door. The doctor hurried after her. They had almost reached the exitâ€¦ but suddenly Iris stopped. She slowly turned, and stepped towards him. The doctor froze.</p>
        <p>The heel of her boot gently, yet precisely, pressed onto his shoeâ€”like a seal. Slowly, as if screwing into his flesh not pain, but fear.</p>
        <p>"You know what will happen if you fail me," her voice was quiet, almost velvety.</p>
        <p>"Y-yesâ€¦ you can rely on me," he stammered, paling. Iris looked directly into his eyes.</p>
        <p>"Forget who he was. Forget what he meant. This is the end of an era." And, as she left, she added: "Let him live. Let him hear me rewrite history."</p>
