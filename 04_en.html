        <h1>Chapter 4. Shadow on the Streets</h1>
        <p>Iris Tanaka stood by the panoramic window of her penthouse, from which the lights of the City stretched out. The glass reflected her figure in a black leather dress — flawless, static, like a sculpture. Somewhere below, far beyond her view, life flowed, full of bustle and ignorance.</p>
        <p>The door slid open silently, and Friedrich Steiner entered — a shadow appearing within the shadows. His movements were fluid, almost soundless, like a predator unwilling to disturb the peace. He stopped a few steps behind her, awaiting her word.</p>
        <p>"Friedrich," — Iris's voice was low, calm, like the whisper of a night wind. She did not turn. — "How are things with... preparing the ground?"</p>
        <p>"The ground is ready, Madam," — Steiner replied in an even tone, devoid of any emotion. — "The seeds are sown. We just need to wait for the first shoots."</p>
        <p>Iris smiled slightly, her lips barely curving. "Shoots are always demanding. They need... stress. For the roots to go deeper."</p>
        <p>"We can provide the necessary stress," — Steiner offered, and in his voice, there seemed to be a barely perceptible note of anticipation. — "Small tremors. Enough to disrupt equilibrium, but not to overturn the system."</p>
        <p>"Equilibrium is an illusion, Friedrich," — Iris finally turned. Her eyes seemed to absorb all the darkness of the night sky. — "True equilibrium is born from chaos. From the realization of the fragility of everything that was considered unshakable."</p>
        <p>"The people demand stability," — Steiner reminded her.</p>
        <p>"The people demand bread and circuses. And when both are lacking, they begin to seek answers," — Iris took a step towards him. — "And we will give them answers. Our answers."</p>
        <p>"And what about... sources of instability?" — Steiner looked directly at her, and in that gaze was complete understanding. — "Uncontrolled elements."</p>
        <p>"All elements are controllable, Friedrich. The only question is the price," — Iris ran her finger over the tip of her nail, perfectly manicured and sharp. — "And how deep we are willing to dig to find the right levers. Everyone has their fulcrum. We just need to find it."</p>
        <p>"It will be done, Madam," — Steiner nodded, and in that movement was a promise not just of execution, but of a deep understanding of the unspoken.</p>
        <p>Iris turned back to the window, and her silhouette dissolved into the reflection of the City. "Let the City remember what true power is. Not the one that whispers, but the one that shakes foundations."</p>
        <p>Silence again filled the penthouse, broken only by the barely audible hum of the distant megalopolis, which would soon feel a new shadow upon itself.</p>
