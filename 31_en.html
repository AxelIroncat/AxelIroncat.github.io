        <h1>Chapter 31. So Close</h1>

        <p>The common room had gone still. Everyone had turned in for the night.Everyone but Max.</p>
        <p>He sat alone on the sofa, one leg tucked beneath him, absently disassembling a wrist-mounted amplifier module.Laid out on the table before him were scraps of tech: tiny components, a pair of batteries, the stripped casing of an old field generator — mental toys to keep his hands busy and his thoughts from spiraling into darker places.</p>
        <p>He sighed, staring blankly at the circuit board.Too much had happened.And far too much was still coming.</p>
        <p>Then — a sound behind him.Not footsteps. More like a shift in air.The movement of a shadow across the carpet. So quiet, her presence was felt before it was heard.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere changed — subtly, completely.The air filled with a scent so faint he nearly doubted it: delicate like a night-blooming flower, clean as frost… and underneath it, something wilder. Sharp, electric. Like storm-soaked earth and blood — something meant to be sensed, not smelled.</p>
        <p>Lis slid onto the sofa beside him. Not just sat — moved like she belonged. A silent, feline grace, claiming not just the cushion but perhaps the whole world around it. Her hair brushed his shoulder — silk against skin — and that single touch sent a whisper of static racing down his spine.</p>
        <p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her: legs stretched in front of her, posture relaxed, gaze razor-sharp. Too focused for idle curiosity — she was watching him work with the alert stillness of a hunter.</p>
        <p>And her nearness, that quiet gravity…It stirred something in him.Something warm. Something raw. Something fragile.As if, for one stolen moment, the chaos of the world had gone silent — and only her silence remained.</p>
        <p>He could feel the blood pulsing in his temples, every heartbeat echoing louder in her presence.God, he wanted to touch her. Just gently fix that loose strand of hair. To feel her skin.And the realization frightened him — because somewhere deep inside, past reason and fear and everything else, he knew:He wanted to kiss her.</p>
        <p>Now.Even if the world burned for it.</p>
        <p>“Well then,” Lis leaned forward, examining the table. “What’s all this junk?”</p>
        <p>“It’s not junk,” Max said, managing a smile. “This is… more or less everything we’ve got against the corporate army.”</p>
        <p>“So, toys,” she said, tucking one leg beneath her. “Just very angry ones.”</p>
        <p>He pointed. “Field amplifier. Goes into boots or wrist mounts. If tuned right, gives you a burst — lets me jump higher, move faster. That feeling when you fly from rooftop to rooftop… it’s like freedom with velocity.”</p>
        <p>For a second, he drifted, remembering that flight.Then he continued.</p>
        <p>“Shields — over here. For cushioning impacts, bullets, even direct hits. But they only hold for a few seconds. And this…”He twirled a flat silver cylinder between his fingers. “Blade module. Needs a hilt, a power feed, and a stabilizer.”</p>
        <p>“A sword?” she asked casually. Then added, “That’s what took down that soldier. So it really cuts through their tin-can armor?”</p>
        <p>He nodded. “It’s a focused edge field. It’ll slice through anything you can name — as long as the battery holds.”</p>
        <p>Lis was quiet for a beat.</p>
        <p>“Could you…” she hesitated, biting her lip, “I mean — if you wanted to… could you make all this for someone else?”</p>
        <p>Max looked at her.</p>
        <p>Of course not. Blinov wouldn’t even approve of him <i>talking</i> about this tech, let alone <i>building it</i> for someone else.But those eyes…</p>
        <p>There was something in them deeper than rebellion, older than playfulness. A need that didn’t know how to ask — because it didn’t expect “no” as an answer.</p>
        <p>He nodded slowly.“If someone’s crazy enough to roof-hop with this kind of gear, I’ll help. Especially if that someone has perfect balance. And… charisma.”</p>
        <p>Lis gave a faint smile.</p>
        <p>“Perfect? You mean you?”</p>
        <p>“No. You.”He said it plainly, then looked away, surprised at himself.“I mean… learning to use this stuff — it’s not like skating. It’s serious.”</p>
        <p>“Mhm.” She reached for the module. “Then maybe you’ll build me a few toys? Jump, strike, look good — the essentials.”</p>
        <p>“Looking good <i>is</i> essential,” he agreed. “But seriously… I’d build you anything. Just tell me the truth. Why do you want it? The blade, I mean. You know how dangerous it is.”</p>
        <p>Her gaze lingered on him — deep, thoughtful, far older than she looked.Then, with a glint of mischief, she said softly:</p>
        <p>“Well, for one thing — I’m a girl. I want a shiny toy.”Then quieter:“Not just for fun. For survival.”And softer still, like a secret whisper lost in the dark:“To be free. Fast. Untouchable.Like the wind.”</p>
        <p>Pause.“Like you.”</p>
        <p>Max stopped breathing for a second.Then exhaled — slow, shaky.</p>
        <p>“Then I’ll build you the best. Even if I have to tear apart every module I’ve got.”</p>
        <p>“But you should know,” he added quietly, “This blade is lethal. It’s not a toy. You swing your arm with it on — and you could kill someone.”</p>
        <p>Lis’s lips curled into a feral smile.“Perfect. Especially if they’re wearing a corporate badge.”</p>
        <p>There was something ancient and wild in that grin. A predator’s joy — unfiltered and unapologetic.It made Max’s pulse stutter.</p>
        <p>“And the more of them in my way,” she said, “the fewer there’ll be.”</p>
        <p>“Lis, this isn’t a game. It’s a life.”</p>
        <p>“They’ll kill you. I’ll just be the good person who struck first.” She shrugged. “Fair’s fair.”</p>
        <p>“How do you even know he’s bad?” Max asked. “Because you want him to be? Or because you’ve got a weapon that says he can be?”</p>
        <p>“Maybe he’s good to his family.”</p>
        <p>“Then maybe he shouldn’t work for a slaughterhouse,” she snapped. “Actions have consequences. Get in my way — you pay the price.”She jumped to her feet and struck a mock combat pose on the couch.“Don’t test me!”</p>
        <p>“Wait. Lis — just listen a second.”</p>
        <p>She sat back down, eyes locking with his. Unblinking. Cutting.</p>
        <p>“Your father worked for the corporation,” Max said. “More than that — he <i>led</i> part of it.”</p>
        <p>That gave her pause. Not pain — but thought.The realization that even the strongest ties were still just… ties.</p>
        <p>“Everyone’s a hero in their own head,” Max continued. “No villain thinks they’re the villain. We all have excuses. And we don’t care about anyone else’s.”</p>
        <p>Her face grew still, serious.He watched her — the curve of her lips, the reflection in her eyes — trying to decipher the mystery that could switch so quickly from flirtation to cold logic.</p>
        <p>“But we <i>are</i> fighting the corporation,” she said.</p>
        <p>“Exactly. We fight them because they think they can decide who lives and dies. Because they believe power gives them the right.”</p>
        <p>He looked at her.</p>
        <p>“And if we do the same… how are we any better?”</p>
        <p>“Then what? How do we beat them if we can’t kill them?”</p>
        <p>“Victory isn’t about body counts. The best win is the one that doesn’t need blood.”</p>
        <p>She narrowed her eyes. “So if we run into armed soldiers next time, what — you’ll <i>talk</i> them to death?”</p>
        <p>“If the situation allows — I’ll try.” He smiled.</p>
        <p>“But if there’s no other choice, I’ll fight. I <i>know</i> why I’m fighting.And I’ll try to win with the least damage possible. That’s all I can promise.”</p>
        <p>Lis touched his hand.Just barely.But it was enough. Enough to send cold fire down his arm, to freeze time for half a breath.</p>
        <p>She leaned in slightly.</p>
        <p>“You’d make a good teacher, Max.”Her voice was soft. “Shame you can’t go back to the university.”Then, slyly:“But let’s be honest — you’d be miserable without chases, bullets, and me.”</p>
        <p>She smiled — a crooked, dangerous smile, the kind that didn’t offer safety.The kind that <i>dared</i> you to follow her off the edge.</p>
        <p>“And fine. You’ve convinced me. I don’t need the blade.Not <i>yet</i> .”She winked. “But I do want to jump.”</p>
        <p>She laughed — quiet, rustling, like wind in tall grass.Then swung her legs up onto the table — those perfect, smugly lethal boots — and inspected them with measured appreciation.</p>
        <p>“In case it’s not obvious — the amplifiers go <i>here</i> . I’m not changing my style for tech. And the color? Something sleek. Black. Maybe with a pink highlight?”</p>
        <p>Max glanced at her legs.And suddenly, the entire world narrowed — to the sofa, her voice, and the arc of her smile.</p>
        <p>“You’ll have it,” he said. “The most elegant field interface in the world.”</p>
        <p>He hesitated.</p>
        <p>“There’s just one problem. You said it yourself — I can’t exactly walk into the university right now. But the tools we need are still in the lab. And the parts too. Enough for a few more full generator builds.”</p>
        <p>Lis didn’t blink.</p>
        <p>“So what are we waiting for? It’s three hours till dawn.”</p>
        <p>“What if it’s a trap?”</p>
        <p>“At two in the morning? In that dump? No one’s waiting for you by the window.”She rose with a bounce, practically skipping toward the exit.“Come on. I’ve got a nose for ambushes. Trust me — I know the smell.”</p>
        <p>Max grumbled under his breath, dragging himself upright.</p>
        <p>“Yeah. Just like there <i>wasn’t</i> a trap at the data center.”</p>
        <p>But he followed anyway.Of course he did.</p>
