        <h1>Chapter 28. In the Collector Tunnels</h1>

        <p>The collector tunnels were narrow and damp. The air was heavy, laced with the taste of rot and ozone, soaked through with a stagnant mustiness. In the distance, the murmur of water echoed, and cold droplets rhythmically dripped from rusted pipes, each fall muffled by concrete walls and multiplied in echo. The emergency lamps, sparse and dim, cast yellow blotches on moss-covered walls, only emphasizing the darkness in which the corridor’s curves disappeared. The smell of moisture, metal, and mildew hung thick in the air, settling on the tongue with a bitter aftertaste.</p>
        <p>Max walked in the rear, still feeling the fight pulsing through his body: sore muscles, aching arms, a mind buzzing with adrenaline and leftover emotion. But most of all, he couldn’t stop thinking about <i>her</i>. Her image, bright and elusive, circled in his thoughts like a persistent melody. A few steps more, and he quickened his pace, catching up to the girl. He pulled off his mask, breathing in the musty air, and said quietly, almost stumbling over the words:</p>
        <p>"Alicia?"</p>
        <p>"Just call me Lis," she replied without turning. Her voice was steady, with not a trace of surprise, as if she'd been expecting the question.</p>
        <p>"You knew who I was?"</p>
        <p>She finally looked at him, and in her eyes was that familiar half-smile—the one he remembered from the lecture hall—full of challenge and something untamed.</p>
        <p>"Of course. Who else in this city would jump through a window into someone else’s fight?" she said with complete confidence, as though she'd read his mind. There was a teasing note in her voice, but her gaze was sharp and discerning.</p>
        <p>Max gave a short laugh, feeling his cheeks warm with embarrassment. It felt like she could see straight through him, and that thought was both unsettling and magnetic.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to ask... where did you go? Why didn't you come back to the university? I... I was worried."</p>
        <p>She slowed her pace and tilted her head slightly, speaking with an exaggeratedly guilty but featherlight tone:</p>
        <p>"Sorry, Maksim Aleksandrovich, I didn’t mean to skip class... My grandmother got sick. Or my cat. Or maybe we went on a field trip to tour the sewer system—who remembers?" She batted her eyelashes at him, her pale eyes too innocent to trust. Her smile widened. "Stop worrying. I'm fine. I always land on my feet."</p>
        <p>Max tried to keep a serious expression, but the corners of his mouth betrayed him. At least she remembered his name. That was something.</p>
        <p>"Just promise me you won't open fire during lectures," he muttered with a grin.</p>
        <p>"Oh, well that depends on the syllabus," Lis replied with a shrug. There was a glint of amusement in her voice, and she gave him the faintest wink.</p>
        <p>Up ahead, there was a sharp noise—someone stumbling. Royce, dragging Green through a low, damp passage, muttered a curse that echoed against the wet walls.</p>
        <p>"By the way," Lis continued, nodding toward the brute struggling ahead, "this is Royce. He usually carries my bags... and fends off overly persistent admirers."</p>
        <p>Royce growled without turning, his voice dry and gravelly:</p>
        <p>"Keep talking and you can carry your own 'bag.' Though this one doesn’t have a handle. Or wheels." He spat on the concrete, then glanced around. "What a dump. And why the hell are we taking this route, Lis? It's longer. And it reeks."</p>
        <p>Lis traced her finger along the damp wall, then shrugged.</p>
        <p>"Longer, yeah. But it helps if someone decides to follow us. Though the humidity is a disaster—my hair's starting to curl. Completely unacceptable." She sighed theatrically, adjusting a strand.</p>
        <p>Max nodded, feeling some of the tension ease from his body under the pressure valve of her humor. He moved forward, glancing around. The corridor widened, the concrete drier now, and the dim light revealed damp walls and thick cable bundles under the ceiling, snaking like giant serpents through the maze.</p>
        <p>"Are you with the Legion?" Max asked. "What happened to it?"</p>
        <p>Lis didn’t answer immediately. A flicker of reflection crossed her face.</p>
        <p>"The Legion... It's hard to say what that even means now. It used to be more of a network presence—slogans, leaflets, than real resistance. We were part of what they called the Freedom Legion. Now... only those who didn’t give up remain. Just a few of us, still breathing. And those who understand that fighting outside the corporation’s rules is the only way to win."</p>
        <p>"So you are fighting the corporation?"</p>
        <p>"Call it what you want," she said, her gaze passing over the dim lights before settling on Max. "Sometimes it’s enough just to go where others are afraid to look. Where the light doesn’t reach. Where their rules don’t apply."</p>
        <p>Max paused, turning her words over in his mind. There was a quiet exhaustion in them, but also unbending resolve. He thought Lis’s group might be the allies he needed to find the professor. Then he said:</p>
        <p>"I’m looking for my advisor. You must know him, if you attended his lectures. Professor Blinov. I think the corporation was behind his abduction. He’s... important. Not just to me. To all of us."</p>
        <p>"I recognize their style," Lis said, casting him a quick, searching glance, trying to see what lay behind his words—if it was more than just personal motivation.</p>
        <p>Royce stepped forward, hoisting Green higher over his shoulder and growled without turning:</p>
        <p>"Tell me something, new guy... How the hell did you end up outside a window on the forty-third floor? And why'd you fall in instead of splattering on the pavement?"</p>
        <p>Max hesitated for a second—the question hit like a punch, blunt and sharp. The last remark made him flush deeper. He’d replayed that moment in his mind more than once, but still had no idea how ridiculous it sounded from the outside. Heat crept up his neck and he quickly looked away.</p>
        <p>"It... just happened," he said, trying to gather himself. "I had gear. A prototype. And a bit of luck."</p>
        <p>"Just happened," Royce muttered, openly mocking now. "Next you’ll say someone opened the window for you."</p>
        <p>Max was about to retort, irritation flaring, but Lis cut in, locking eyes with him. Something flickered there—something he couldn’t quite name.</p>
        <p>"Speaking of accidents. Lawrence wants to meet you. He saw what you did—through the cameras. And I think you two already know each other. This isn’t a casual invitation."</p>
        <p>Max raised his eyebrows.</p>
        <p>"Adam Lawrence?"</p>
        <p>"That’s the one," she nodded. "I think you’ll have plenty to talk about."</p>
        <p>Max felt fatigue pressing in again. Down here, time seemed to lose all meaning.</p>
        <p>Her fingers brushed his hand—just for a moment, a subtle touch, but it wasn’t by accident. For Max, it felt like a current. A strange warmth pulsed through him, driving away the tunnel's gloom. For a moment, he felt protected. And very close to her—as if for the first time, he could truly feel she was real.</p>
