        <h1>Chapter 26. No Rules Fight</h1>

        <p>The soldiers moved as one—silent, mechanical, precise. Not a single word, not a single gesture. Just synchronized footsteps thudding against the server room floor, echoing like war drums in a temple of circuits. The air itself tensed.</p>
        <p>Lis felt a cold surge rise within her. Not fear—focus. The kind that came when your body already understood what your mind was still trying to grasp: you don’t fight armor. You avoid it.</p>
        <p>The first soldier lunged, his massive arm slicing the air. Lis slid sideways—the blow missed her head by mere centimeters, the wake of it brushing her hair. At that same instant, Royce hurled himself forward, throwing his full weight into a shoulder strike. The impact barely made the soldier stagger—but it was enough. Lis slipped past the gap like a gust of wind.</p>
        <p>“Royce! Their armor’s tank-grade!” she shouted, diving into a side roll. The pistols were already in her hands, but she didn’t fire. What was the point? Bullets were meaningless now. Agility was everything.</p>
        <p>She ducked behind the second soldier, kicked hard at the back of his knee. The leg twitched, nothing more. She swore, flipped sideways as an armored elbow slashed the air where her head had been, and rolled out of reach.</p>
        <p>“Glorified tin cans,” she muttered, ducking behind a server table. “Guess we’re opening them by hand.”</p>
        <p>Royce, meanwhile, was on a rampage. He grabbed a heavy office chair and swung it like a war hammer. It cracked against a soldier’s back. The soldier dropped to one knee—and rose again like it meant nothing.</p>
        <p>Lis leapt backward to evade another grab, raised both pistols, and emptied a burst straight at a visor. The bullets pinged off harmlessly, leaving only faint scratches.</p>
        <p>“Fantastic. Now he’s pissed,” she called out, half-laughing, half-breathless.</p>
        <p>Green stood slightly apart, watching the fight with a frozen face. Lis shot him a glance like a dagger—“Satisfied?”—before spinning away from another blow. A steel fist cleaved the air a breath from her cheek. One more close call, maybe two, and they’d be boxed in.</p>
        <p>Royce was still fighting, but his fists thudded uselessly against their chests. One of the soldiers caught his arm and slammed him down with crushing force. The floor shuddered. His lungs emptied in a gasp, and for a second, the world went black. He groaned, teeth clenched, as he dragged himself up.</p>
        <p>“Royce!” Lis shouted, weaving between steel tables and humming towers of server racks.</p>
        <p>He gave a quick shake of the head. Still standing.</p>
        <p>The soldiers began closing in—slow, relentless. Cutting them off from the exit. Herding them toward the terminal.</p>
        <p>Lis’s jaw clenched. Rage flickered behind her eyes—rage at Green, at the corporation, at this faceless, walking metal. <i>Think, Lis, think…</i></p>
        <p>She launched herself off a rack, slid low, gracefully dodging a strike, caught the edge of a shelf, and vaulted over the corridor in one seamless, feline motion.</p>
        <p>And then—she saw it.</p>
        <p>The panoramic window. Massive, thick, spotless. Near the top corner, a tiny hole… with hairline cracks radiating outward.</p>
        <p>Out there, beyond the glass, something moved. Someone.</p>
        <p>Lis froze for half a heartbeat, eyes narrowing.</p>
        <p>“Looks like the party’s not over yet…” she murmured, a faint smirk tugging at the corner of her lips.</p>
        <p>Then she spun, just in time to dodge another blow.</p>
