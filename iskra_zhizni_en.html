Spark of Life  
or  
Revelation of the Alien  

Do you think you know who you are — your origins, your history? Not sure? Then let me tell you ours.  

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away... Well, that's been done before.  
In times long past by human reckoning, in the distant reaches of space, on a tiny planet, our species emerged.  

We are not so different from you. Not in appearance or size. If we met face to face, giants like you would never even notice our existence. But just like you, we strive to eat and reproduce. And so, like for you, the struggle for survival is natural. And as a consequence, so is war...  

Like you, we began to stand out among other species because we learned not only to change ourselves to adapt to the world around us, but also to change the world to suit ourselves. We started by creating tools for production and for killing others. Then we learned to unite for common goals, and eventually, we began warring over resources with our own kind.  

Our bodies were frail, so we sought protection outside ourselves. At first, it was stationary housing, like your homes, but then we realized that if your home moves, your chances of getting the resources you need increase. So we began creating large mobile modules — ships. And we didn't just build these modules from inanimate matter like you do; we grew them from organic material, and our homes were like us, with their own code by which they were designed.  

But there weren't enough resources for everyone. There were so many of us, and we loved to multiply. So those with mobile homes attacked the stationary ones in a bid to seize their resources.  

In turn, those others began uniting and building large stationary dwellings, which allowed them not only to fend off attackers but to destroy them and claim their resources.  

In the end, our ship-homes grew larger and more complex, as survival demanded ever more intricate mechanisms each time.  

Each battle for resources brought not only spoils, but experience hard-earned. Then, when a ship became too crowded, we had to relocate half the population to another. And we taught our ships to divide, creating a copy. After that, we'd split across the ships and could continue attacking the enemy with two vessels. Perhaps like pirate crews in your history.  

And at some point, we were already warring with entire squadrons, and victory often went to those squadrons that could act as one.  

Eventually, we populated the entire planet and kept fighting. Whether the planet was too small or we grew too numerous, the planet's resources were no longer enough. Wars grew more brutal. And the weapons we devised for war became too deadly. We destroyed our planet. And ourselves along with it.  

You'll ask how I'm speaking to you now? Yes, there were some survivors wise enough to realize that our species was doomed to multiply and fight until it annihilated itself. They understood that the only way out was to leave the planet's bounds and multiply elsewhere.  

Fortunately, our ship-building technology already allowed for such journeys.  

But even in space, we started warring over resources, over control of their distribution. The fate of our planet taught us nothing. And the farther we spread through space, the larger and more monstrous our ships became.  

We colonized planets, multiplied, evolved — until others came, even more vicious, hungrier, crueler — and devoured those planets, or the planet would perish in war. Our kind fled ever farther, seeking new resources or escape from the stronger. And the worlds we ravaged remained lifeless for billions of years.  

My race managed to stop this in the only way possible. We ceased reproducing. We weren't the only ones who heeded reason and tried... But the others were devoured by the wild ones, those who refused to abandon their nature. We were just lucky to remain unnoticed.  

While the rest of our species surged into the outer worlds, devouring them and leaving them like locusts, our race went into hiding and moved back through the devastated worlds. We no longer reproduce. We no longer need much to exist. And perhaps one day we'll return to our home world, remaining guardians of our own legacy.  

But after a billion years, we began encountering long-ravaged but reborn worlds. And among them, by some miracle, we found survivors — like you!  

Want to ask how you could be the surviving descendants of our species? It's not such a big mystery.  

Those who survived on this planet evidently went feral and lost all knowledge of our civilizations.  

Only a few loners survived on small ships. They lost their language and all culture. But the key thing that remained was their ships, capable of replicating themselves according to the code you call DNA. And through random mutations in the struggle for survival, what were once ships evolved in complexity until they began to green, swim, run, and fly. And then they acquired their own intelligence.  

And the descendants of those who were passengers on the first ships still live inside you, serving as the spark of your life. You sense their collective as your soul. And your scientists call them mitochondria.  

And now, thanks to you, our race has a purpose: to protect you from those devourers who will return sooner or later. But who can tell? Perhaps one day, it will be they who will need protection — from you...
