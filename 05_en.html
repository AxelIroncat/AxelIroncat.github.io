        <h1>Chapter 5. University Life</h1>
        <p>The night was silent, but Max heard the pulsating roar of waves, carrying deep into his consciousness. They gradually changed shape and brightness, as if space itself was speaking to his heart. Light emerged between the crests of the waves: at first vague glimmers, and then everything around became dazzlingly white. And beyond the light, he saw Her. She stood in the void, fragile and perfect: ideal facial contours, a cold gleam in her eyes, and a posture full of dignity. Her presence preceded everything, and now the world had only to follow her shadow.</p>
        <p>He woke up in a cold sweat: his heart was pounding wildly, his breathing short and choppy. Outside the window, dawn was already breaking: the first rays of sunrise slowly dispelled the night's darkness. The room was quiet; only the sensation of excitement on his skin reminded him of what he had experienced. It wasn't just a dream — the feeling of her presence still trembled within him for some time after waking. Max ran a hand over his face: inside, he was still trembling, not from fear, but from a premonition.</p>
        <p>He arrived at the university early. The corridors were empty, only the distant hum of ventilation resonated in the air. The laboratory was plunged into semi-darkness: screens danced with ghostly flickering waves. Max pressed the switch, took off his jacket, and sat down at the instrument. On the monitor, familiar patterns of oscillations sparked again, echoing his own breathing. The feeling from his first encounter with the waves matched what he had dreamed that night: reality for a moment seemed like a continuation of the dream.</p>
        <p>Professor Blinov entered and sat down at the table.</p>
        <p>"You're early today," he said in a calm, but firm voice.</p>
        <p>Max involuntarily smiled. "Couldn't sleep," he replied quietly.</p>
        <p>Blinov nodded. "Sit closer. It's time for us to talk about the next step."</p>
        <p>Max sat opposite him, sensing a strange seriousness in his mentor's voice. "You are no longer just an assistant. You and I are no longer within the framework of one project. We are in the process… of transition. And I need you to start participating in the educational process. Lead labs, answer students' questions. As a full-fledged lecturer."</p>
        <p>Max blinked. "You mean… me?"</p>
        <p>"Of course, you. Who else? You don't just understand what we're doing. You feel why. And that's a rarity. Students need to see that."</p>
        <p>Max blushed slightly, but said nothing. Somewhere deep inside, a familiar feeling flared up — a mixture of pride, anxiety, and something akin to happiness.</p>
        <p>"And yes," the professor added, "you will choose what to teach yourself. We have labs in general physics, a practical course in theoretical mechanics…"</p>
        <p>Max chuckled. "Do you think I can handle it? I was a student myself not long ago."</p>
        <p>"Everyone starts with their first time. But you will manage — you don't just know the material, you live it."</p>
        <p>He wanted to say something, but only nodded. Somewhere inside, a strange feeling passed through him — he himself had been sitting at a desk just yesterday. And now he was about to be on the other side — standing at the board, explaining, guiding. It was both appealing and a little frightening. How would the students perceive him?</p>
        <p>The next morning, Max got up especially early. Before the mirror, he adjusted his tie and felt a slight surge of pride: today he would appear before an audience as a lecturer for the first time. The auditorium was still empty as he connected the equipment and checked the projector. At the end of the laboratory tables stood a setup with a stretched string: the topic of the lesson was resonance.</p>
        <p>The first to enter were two guys. One — with light stubble and a mocking gaze, the other — tall, with a neat hairstyle. They took seats in the middle of the auditorium. Behind them — a girl with huge eyes and long eyelashes. She sat closer to Max, her gaze fixed on him. Next — another, in glasses, with her hair pulled back and a direct, confident gaze. They exchanged glances, and the one in glasses chuckled.</p>
        <p>"Good morning," Max said, turning on the screen. "My name is Maxim Alexandrovich. Today is our first lab. I hope it will be not only useful, but also interesting."</p>
        <p>He began reading the list, checking faces, and immediately remembered four: eyelashes — Anna, glasses — Diana, neat guy — Nick, and the one with stubble — Dan. The others settled down more calmly, but Max noted to himself: the audience as a whole was quite lively.</p>
        <p>Max turned on the screen and began his explanation. He proceeded to explain the experiment: exciting oscillations of a stretched string using a variable electromagnetic field. Max's voice trembled slightly, but his words flowed evenly and enthusiastically as he described how the string resonated under the influence of alternating current. Students engaged in the discussion: Diana immediately asked a clarifying question, and Dan and Nick first joked among themselves, then seriously delved into the topic. Anna, meanwhile, watched Max more closely than the string itself: her gaze burned with curiosity.</p>
        <p>By the end of the lesson, Max realized he had even finished a little early. He looked around the auditorium: "Any questions? Is everything clear?"</p>
        <p>Diana raised her hand. "Not a question. Just… I hope you'll continue to teach the course. It was really interesting."</p>
        <p>Max smiled. "Professor Blinov teaches the main course. I conduct the laboratory sessions."</p>
        <p>Nick added: "I never thought physics could be such… alive."</p>
        <p>"Thank you," Max nodded. "Tomorrow I'm working with the second group. Is there anything I need to know about them?"</p>
        <p>Diana sighed. "Everyone's normal. Except Lis."</p>
        <p>Max raised an eyebrow. "And what makes her worthy of special mention?"</p>
        <p>"She's… special. Very smart. But she loves to argue with professors, especially if she can make them look foolish. She's studying at two faculties at once — here and in economics. She has connections. It seems one of her parents is an important figure in 'Kairo' Corporation. She acts as if she can afford anything."</p>
        <p>"I'd let her get away with a lot too," Nick chuckled, and then flinched when Diana shot him a look.</p>
        <p>"Try saying that to her face," she said coldly.</p>
        <p>Nick became embarrassed, looked away. Dan quietly laughed.</p>
        <p>Max leaned against the edge of the table, slightly raised an eyebrow and thought to himself: "So, tomorrow will be an interesting day too."</p>
        <p>The next morning was clear, and Max, despite the poor sleep that had become a habit, felt more confident. He arrived at the university early again, carefully adjusting his suit and tie. The same waves of anxiety as before surged within him, but with each breath, he felt a growing calmness: waves were his element.</p>
        <p>Students began to settle into their desks. And then She entered. She made no noise and did not rush — she simply appeared, as if the very density of the air changed, condensing and adjusting to her steps. Around her, it instantly grew cooler, a faint floral scent wafted behind her, and sound seemed to freeze, yielding to her presence.</p>
        <p>She walked forward slowly and confidently, like a slowed wave. An expensive leather jacket, short and revealing her waist, fit flawlessly. Tight trousers emphasized her slender figure. High boots, likely made of genuine leather, probably cost several of his annual salaries. Platinum hair, with barely perceptible pink streaks, like brushstrokes of an artist, flowed freely over her shoulders. Apparently, some cry of rebellion.</p>
        <p>She didn't raise her eyes: she took a seat in the third row and lazily opened her tablet. Only when he spoke did she raise her gaze.</p>
        <p>And Max lost his train of thought for a second. Her light eyes were incredibly deep. Not icy, not warm — no. They were… elusive, like a water mirror on a cloudy day. Nothing superfluous was reflected in them, but that was precisely what was confusing. He felt warm and uncomfortable inside at the same time. His heart foolishly sped up, and his thoughts became jumbled for a second. It wasn't just physical attraction; in her gaze, in her demeanor, there was something Max couldn't define, but something that seemed familiar to him, almost resonating with his own inner world. He seemed to see in her a reflection of that mysterious figure from his dream, and this simultaneously attracted and frightened him.</p>
        <p>He tried to joke.</p>
        <p>"Итак, у нас будет лабораторная, по крайней мере, я надеюсь… что никто не взорвёт установку."</p>
        <p>The audience politely laughed, the tension dropped. Max turned on the projector, brought up the first slide, and began his explanation, trying to concentrate on the subject. He presented short theoretical information with growing confidence, occasionally addressing the audience, asking clarifying questions, and even catching a few interested glances. His voice became more confident, his timbre more even, and now he felt that he was again in control of the situation. Formulas, graphs, theories — all of this helped restore his internal balance. Physics had always been an anchor for him, and now it was once again organizing his thoughts.</p>
        <p>But his eyes seemed to want to return to the sector where She sat. On the penultimate slide, he allowed himself a stealthy glance there. His eyes met her gaze. She looked directly at him, without a smile, calmly and precisely. Max felt as if he had drowned in those sapphires: her gaze penetrated his very soul, and the world around him froze for a moment.</p>
        <p>At that very instant, Max clicked the remote: the screen flashed with large letters: "Hooray! I didn't screw up."</p>
        <p>The audience burst into laughter. Max exhaled sharply and, blushing, mumbled: "That's… a test of your sense of humor."</p>
        <p>The laughter turned friendly — no longer at him, but with him. She quietly raised an eyebrow and, with a slight smile, said: "In any case, it wasn't boring." These words sounded more like a statement of fact than praise: there was no mockery, no condescension in them, only confidence and a slight irony.</p>
        <p>In the second half of the lesson, they moved on to practice. The light became brighter, the room filled with the sounds of the experiment. Max checked the system connection, students pulled wires and discussed details. Alicia, as indicated in the list, silently and without fuss began setting up: her movements were precise and confident, her gaze quickly scanning the diagram. She didn't even consult the manual — she immediately connected everything correctly. Max watched intently: everything was done flawlessly, as if she had her own algorithm.</p>
        <p>"Do you have experience?" he couldn't help but ask, approaching closer.</p>
        <p>She, without taking her eyes off the oscilloscope screen, replied in an even voice: "No, I just know how to read."</p>
        <p>Max raised an eyebrow. The girl slightly twisted her lips and quietly added: "Although, maybe that is experience, compared to the others."</p>
        <p>Max smiled: he felt a slight pang in his chest — her words echoed deeply within him.</p>
        <p>She threw a glance at the old equipment and calmly remarked: "It looks like it was dug out of a museum exhibit. But it works — reliably and stubbornly, like an old horse."</p>
        <p>Max snorted slightly in surprise: he still didn't understand if it was a mockery or a curious compliment. Lis smoothly moved to another part of the setup and quietly said: "I'm trying." Then, noticing that Max was listening, she added a little louder: "However, the difficulty of this task was somewhere in middle school."</p>
        <p>He felt his cheeks flush, but he couldn't object: Lis's words were sharp and deliberately spoken. "Sometimes silence is the best proof of intelligence," he thought.</p>
        <p>The clock showed the end of the lesson. Max smiled at the group: "That's all for today, you can hand in your results."</p>
        <p>Students began to disperse, but Alicia still stood by the table. She neatly put her tablet in her bag and took a few steps towards the exit. Her steps were even and light, like the last wave receding on the shore. At the doorway, she stopped and turned for a moment. Their gazes met again. Max caught a faint glimmer of understanding in her eyes, as if she had grasped something important about him in a few seconds. The corners of her lips barely curved into a warm, mysterious smile — with this smile, she left a promise: there was still much unsolved ahead, connected with her. Then, swaying her hips calmly, as if carrying a message, she disappeared from the auditorium.</p>
        <p>Max remained standing alone at the laboratory table. Inside, everything was swirling: fatigue and excitement, inhale and exhale — waves raging in his head. He wanted to capture this feeling, like a standing wave — to hold it inside while it was still fresh. He took a deep breath and quietly smiled: there was time until their next meeting, but memory had already firmly fixed her image. And all he wanted was for the week until the next class to fly by as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon, he couldn't concentrate on working with the setup. The professor noticed this and asked Max how he was feeling. He attributed it to chronic sleep deprivation and his sleepless night.</p>
        <p>"I understand. When I started teaching students, I also felt nervous and couldn't sleep at first. But in our work, we need fresh, working brains. I'm letting you go for today, try to get some sleep."</p>
        <p>The next few days flew by unnoticed. Once he saw a tall guy with a neat hairstyle and light stubble arguing loudly near the entrance to the cafeteria about some lecture that "made no sense at all."</p>
        <p>Max chuckled: no, he was still far from being a student. He was glad.</p>
