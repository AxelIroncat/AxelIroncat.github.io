        <h1>Chapter 34. Into Danger</h1>

        <p>Dusk fell like a curtain, muffling sound and shadow alike. The grove lay silent, its skeletal trees casting elongated silhouettes that cloaked their passage. Max walked ahead, voice low, guiding Royce through the gloves.</p>
        <p>"Took me longer than I wanted," Max murmured, glancing sideways. "In the lab, I’d have fine-tuned everything. But out here—well, we adapt. No time for trial runs. You’ll have to learn on the fly. Lis did. I think you will too.</p>
        <p>Here’s the rundown. Palm out, flat—activates a planar shield about half a meter wide. Stops bullets. Clench hard—sends a shock pulse forward. Could knock someone out. Clench like you’re grabbing something—you pull in objects or cling to walls. Clear?"</p>
        <p>Royce eyed the gloves like he’d been handed alien tech.</p>
        <p>"And I’m not going to fry myself?"</p>
        <p>Max smirked. "Lis didn’t. That’s promising. But they drain fast. Don’t waste power unless it counts. And whatever you do, don’t trigger them near me."</p>
        <p>Royce grunted. "Thanks for the gauntlets. Beats spring-loaded heels. I’d make a terrible cyber-fairy."</p>
        <p>Before Max could retort, the bushes exploded. A blur burst from the shadows—Lis. She flipped midair and landed with feline grace. Her face beamed with wild joy, pink-streaked hair shimmering in twilight.</p>
        <p>"Max, when we get back, I’m kissing you," she grinned. "This is the best gift of my life."</p>
        <p>She twirled, showing off black thigh-high boots molded to her legs. Not just stylish—stabilizers hugged the side straps like sleek wings, impulse modules hidden in the heels, embedded seamlessly.</p>
        <p>She bounced lightly, testing a jump.</p>
        <p>"I’ve dreamed of this forever… just didn’t know it."</p>
        <p>She soared to a nearby branch, landed like she belonged there.</p>
        <p>Max chuckled. "Try not to drain them. I added a landing recoup system, but still—save it for when it counts."</p>
        <p>Lis flashed a mischievous smile, dangling one leg from the branch.</p>
        <p>"Maxik, you have golden hands. No weight. No drag. When I jump… I <i>fly</i> ."</p>
        <p>Royce rolled his eyes. "All we’re missing now is a grenade launcher or two."</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes later, they reached the fence—corroded mesh, rusted support poles, decaying cameras. The correctional facility.</p>
        <p>The silence wrapped around them. Only the soft indentations of their steps pressed into the damp soil. Max stopped at the wall, eyes scanning. Low but solid. Etched with strange, fading patterns—like the remnants of an older, deeper architecture.</p>
        <p>"Ready?" he asked.</p>
        <p>Lis tightened her gear. "Ready."</p>
        <p>Royce nodded. Max clenched his fists, exhaled.</p>
        <p>"Let’s go."</p>
        <p>They climbed where branches laced thick like netting. Moved like phantoms. Barely a whisper of motion. Leaves shifted. Nothing else.</p>
        <p>Lawrence’s voice crackled in their ears.</p>
        <p>"Glitch cleared the system. Cameras looped. Perimeter mostly blind. Get to the roof via north side. One guard, south. No interference expected."</p>
        <p>Max nodded, reoriented. Lis tracked his hands. Royce tested his glove, the hum subtle.</p>
        <p>They advanced. Muscles taut. Every second sharp.</p>
        <p>Max halted.</p>
        <p>Something shifted.</p>
        <p>He glanced south. Empty.</p>
        <p>Lawrence: "Guard’s not there. Circling. You’ve got a window. Move."</p>
        <p>Max looked to Royce. No words needed.</p>
        <p>The guard turned the corner. Royce stepped forward, flicked his wrist. A pulse fired—silent and clean. The man dropped, lifeless as a puppet cut loose.</p>
        <p>"Tested," Royce muttered. "Confirmed."</p>
        <p>Lis smirked. Max nodded.</p>
        <p>"Let’s finish it."</p>
        <p>They scaled the roof. Tools out. Cut a hatch. Dropped through the vent shaft.</p>
        <p>Lawrence again:</p>
        <p>"Glitch is inside. Green’s access still holds. Elevator’s ready. Move fast. You’ve got cover. Don’t linger."</p>
        <p>They slipped through the maintenance tunnel. Doors sealed behind. The cabin descended.</p>
        <p>Below—hollow quiet. They exited. Ahead—a sealed room.</p>
        <p>Inside, a man in white glanced up, visibly annoyed.</p>
        <p>"You’re not supposed to be here," he said flatly. "Restricted zone. Leave."</p>
        <p>Royce stepped forward. Icy calm.</p>
        <p>"Not taking orders. Start talking. What is this place?"</p>
        <p>The man hesitated, read the room.</p>
        <p>"Correctional center. Monitors physical and psychological integrity. Loyalty programs. But… almost empty."</p>
        <p>"Who’s still in?" Max asked.</p>
        <p>"Richard Vale. And Mikhailo. Cells 5B and 7A."</p>
        <p>Lis froze. Her heart seized.</p>
        <p>She bolted.</p>
        <p>No thought—just instinct.</p>
        <p>She hit a guard full-on. Armor-clad. Rifle raised.</p>
        <p>Too slow.</p>
        <p>She veered. Left, then sharp right. Disappeared from sight.</p>
        <p>She launched from the wall, twisted midair, and slammed her heels into his chest. Boosters fired.</p>
        <p>The guard flew. Crashed into the wall. Silent.</p>
        <p>Lis hit the ground hard. Pain. She didn’t care.</p>
        <p>He’s there. Behind that door.</p>
        <p>She ran.</p>
        <p>There he was.</p>
        <p>Richard Vale.</p>
        <p>Strapped. Electrodes pulsing. Writhing.</p>
        <p>She stopped—then dove.</p>
        <p>"Dad!" Her cry broke. She gripped him, sobbing. "You’re alive."</p>
        <p>Max and Royce entered. Royce dragged the lab tech, resisting uselessly. Max knelt by Richard.</p>
        <p>"How do we bring him back?"</p>
        <p>The man swallowed. "Shut down the current. Disable neural block. But… it’s dangerous."</p>
        <p>Royce stepped closer. His voice like steel.</p>
        <p>"We’re <i>already</i> past danger. Speak."</p>
        <p>The man obeyed.</p>
        <p>Lis held her father.</p>
        <p>He stirred. Lids fluttered. Eyes opened.</p>
        <p>"Lis… You came… knew you would…"</p>
        <p>She gripped his hand.</p>
        <p>"Hold on, Dad. Don’t let go."</p>
        <p>He blinked.</p>
        <p>"They tried to break me… But I held on. For you. After your mother… I didn’t know… if I could…"</p>
        <p>He sagged.</p>
        <p>Royce caught him.</p>
        <p>"I’ve got him," he said, lifting Richard easily. "We’ll fix this."</p>
        <p>Max turned to the tech. "Who’s the other one?"</p>
        <p>Lawrence: "Someone’s there. Don’t know who."</p>
        <p>Max moved. Opened the second door.</p>
        <p>Froze.</p>
        <p>The face—familiar.</p>
        <p>The terrorist leader.</p>
        <p>Max blinked. Then:</p>
        <p>"Lawrence. It’s him. The one who tried to kill you."</p>
        <p>Lawrence: "Sure? If he talks, he could clear me. And the Legion. That’s big."</p>
        <p>Max clenched his jaw.</p>
        <p>Strange times. Stranger allies.</p>
        <p>Time to leave.</p>
        <p>They reached the elevator. It chimed.</p>
        <p>Empty.</p>
        <p>Too empty.</p>
        <p>Two prisoners. Whole basement.</p>
        <p>Something was off.</p>
