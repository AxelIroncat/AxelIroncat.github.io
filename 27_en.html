        <h1>Chapter 27. Night Ascent</h1>

        <p>Max stood cloaked in shadow, pressed against the rough concrete wall of a neighboring building, eyes fixed on the silhouette ahead. A monolithic concrete-and-glass tower loomed over the district—not the main Kairo skyscraper, but formidable enough. If the fragmented clues he'd pieced together were accurate, this was where one of the corporation’s data centers was hidden.</p>
        <p>That conclusion had taken days to reach. Max had carefully probed conversations with city workers, especially those with corporate ties, fishing for scraps of information. Bit by bit, the puzzle had come together, pointing to this unremarkable building on the city's edge.</p>
        <p>It may have looked ordinary, but it was anything but unguarded. Cameras watched the main entrance 24/7, and the internal security was likely no less paranoid. A frontal approach was suicide. So Max chose madness: scale the outside, start from the top. He had climbed buildings before—just never one this tall. Still, there might be no second chance to help Professor Blinov.</p>
        <p>He inhaled the cool night air, trying to quiet the trembling in his knees. The very idea of climbing dozens of stories up a blank wall was paralyzing. But then he remembered why he was here. If he failed, Blinov would remain a captive. No one else would come. And worse—the corporation would bleed the truth out of him, the secret Max had helped protect. If not for Max...</p>
        <p>That thought steadied him. Fear still whispered, but resolve had drowned it out. Max checked the seals on his gloves, tightened the straps on his boots, and stepped out into the open.</p>
        <p>He pressed himself to the chilled wall at ground level. Carefully, he raised his right hand—a broad glove encasing it. With a hidden switch, he activated the adhesive field. The glove latched onto the surface with a soft mechanical pull. Max gave it two firm tugs. Secure. He exhaled. Now: up.</p>
        <p>Centimeter by centimeter, he began the climb. Each move demanded total focus. One misstep, and gravity would win. No amount of cushioning field would save him from that fall. He moved with the precision of a machine—right glove, left glove, right boot, left boot—always three anchors before shifting the fourth.</p>
        <p>At the twentieth floor, a gust of wind struck his back. The wall seemed to sway beneath him—or maybe he swayed. His heart plummeted. He froze, clinging to the concrete.</p>
        <p>Below, the city unfurled in glowing ribbons of streetlight. Cars were fireflies. The dizzying height threatened to unravel his composure. He forced his gaze upward. Only up. He locked onto the top, where the building vanished into black sky. The roof was still just as far as he'd already climbed. Terror crawled up his spine.</p>
        <p>He remembered Blinov’s face—worn, proud, hopeful. Believing in Max. That image sent a jolt of strength through him. He pushed upward, faster now, careful but driven. One hand, then the other. One boot, then the next.</p>
        <p>Occasionally the facade turned to seamless glass. No seams, no joints. He would shift sideways, searching for something—a ledge, a panel gap. In those moments, he would dangle by one hand and the opposite foot, while the other foot felt blindly for purchase. The silence was total. Every breath, every motion was magnified.</p>
        <p>Then he saw it.</p>
        <p>A faint white glow ahead. Amid the black wall, one window was lit. A narrow pane. Something was happening in there.</p>
        <p>Max crept closer, hands searching for grip. Heart pounding again, this time with anticipation. He reached the window, staying in the shadows beside the frame. Inside, two figures paced the room, unaware.</p>
        <p>He dared a glance.</p>
        <p>Bright lights reflected off rows of server racks. This was the data center. Near the window stood a cleaning cart and mop bucket. Two uniformed figures moved in rhythm—one mopping, the other fiddling with a terminal. Strange. What cleaner works on a server?</p>
        <p>The taller one bent under the light: large frame, dark skin. Familiar somehow. The smaller figure turned slightly—slender, precise.</p>
        <p>Then it happened. A lock of platinum-white hair slipped free beneath the cap. Pale, with a faint pink hue.</p>
        <p>Max's mind stuttered.</p>
        <p>No. It couldn’t be. Not her.</p>
        <p>She removed the cap, shook her head. The hair fell into place. Her features, unmistakable.</p>
        <p>Alicia Veil.</p>
        <p>The world lurched.</p>
        <p>Shock, joy, disbelief, fear—all surged at once. Alicia. Here. In disguise. A ghost from his past, now a player in this secret war. Just beyond the glass.</p>
        <p>She said something to her partner, eyes sharp with intent. Max couldn’t hear her through the sealed window, but he knew that look. She was here for a reason.</p>
        <p>His breath hitched. His heart was pounding hard enough to shake the frame. He pressed closer to the glass, mesmerized.</p>
        <p>Then the door opened.</p>
        <p>A man entered in a suit. Behind him, armored soldiers.</p>
        <p>Max tensed. Alicia spoke to the man. Not friendly. Tense. Soldiers—armed.</p>
        <p>He needed to hear.</p>
        <p>He drew his compact blade, activating it to fingertip length. Pressed it gently to the glass, cut a palm-sized circle. A faint grind. The piece came free—he caught it silently.</p>
        <p>Now a clean hole. Sound filtered through.</p>
        <p>He leaned in.</p>
        <p>"...my father... kidnapping... I just want him back, because I miss him..."</p>
        <p>His chest tightened.</p>
        <p>It was about her father. The suit mumbled about Iris, the rules. Alicia cut him down: "Can't you even doubt?" Sharp. Cold. Furious.</p>
        <p>"You were a family friend," she said. "Now you just chant 'Iris, Iris...' like a mantra."</p>
        <p>Max's stomach turned. She was in danger. About to be taken.</p>
        <p>He saw her, standing side-on, pistols low but ready. The man opposite: Thomas, maybe. Three soldiers, poised.</p>
        <p>Then the words came.</p>
        <p>"Take them alive."</p>
        <p>Max moved.</p>
        <p>No thought. No fear. Only: protect her.</p>
        <p>He set the glass down, activated the full-length blade. No time for caution.</p>
        <p>Cut. Hum. Crack. The whole pane fell inward.</p>
        <p>Max jumped.</p>
        <p>In midair, he triggered his shield.</p>
        <p>A soldier turned, rifle raised. Fired.</p>
        <p>The shot hit the field. Max felt the pressure transfer to his belt. He landed, ducked, swung. The blade struck the rifle’s barrel joint—split clean in two.</p>
        <p>The soldier froze. Max didn’t.</p>
        <p>Alicia was almost cornered. Too close. Max sprinted. From behind, he raised his left hand, turned the wrist—repulsor blast, direct to the helmet.</p>
        <p>Perfect hit.</p>
        <p>The soldier flew sideways. Collapsed.</p>
        <p>Recoil shoved Max back. Shoulder screamed. Didn’t matter.</p>
        <p>Alicia was moving. She dove, reengaged. No time to talk. No time to explain.</p>
        <p>The first soldier was back up.</p>
        <p>Boots thundered. Max turned—too slow. Hit in the back. The shield caught it, but the belt dug deep. He slid, gasped.</p>
        <p>Another lunge. Bare fists now. Max raised the blade, didn’t strike. Fear of killing held him. Not again. Not like before.</p>
        <p>Blow hit. Shield flared. Max crashed into a server.</p>
        <p>"I can’t," he thought.</p>
        <p>Then—a blur.</p>
        <p>Alicia.</p>
        <p>Leaping. Spinning. A kick to the helmet. Not to harm. To disrupt.</p>
        <p>The soldier staggered.</p>
        <p>Max dove low. Slammed the blade into his foot.</p>
        <p>The scream came even through the helmet. The soldier dropped, one knee down.</p>
        <p>Pain twisted in Max’s gut. He hated it.</p>
        <p>But he had to. To protect meant to hurt.</p>
        <p>The last one remained.</p>
        <p>He had Royce pinned. The big man was faltering. Blows fell like hammers.</p>
        <p>Alicia didn’t wait.</p>
        <p>Point-blank shots. Clang. Sparks. No effect.</p>
        <p>But distraction was enough.</p>
        <p>She sidestepped. Created space.</p>
        <p>Behind them—a rasp. Metal tearing.</p>
        <p>The soldier turned—too late.</p>
        <p>Royce swung a battery like a hammer. It crashed into the helmet. The soldier dropped like a stone.</p>
        <p>Silence. Smell of ozone.</p>
        <p>Green stared at the fallen. Three elite soldiers—down. In seconds.</p>
        <p>He stepped back, instinct taking over.</p>
        <p>Alicia pounced. One leap. Gun pressed to Green’s forehead.</p>
        <p>"You have the eyes of my dog when he ruined the carpet. Remember Buddy? He never betrayed me."</p>
        <p>Max approached.</p>
        <p>"Wait..."</p>
        <p>She didn’t turn. Raised the second pistol. Aimed it at him.</p>
        <p>"Quiet. Family drama finale. Who are you supposed to be?"</p>
        <p>Max lifted his hands.</p>
        <p>"Do you always greet rescue with a gun to the face?"</p>
        <p>"One more step and you'll be the first to die for friendship."</p>
        <p>Then—slowly—she turned. Their eyes met. She saw everything. Always had.</p>
        <p>"Thought you’d arrive with more style. Still—right on cue. What class is this again?"</p>
        <p>A smirk.</p>
        <p>The pistol lowered.</p>
        <p>Max hadn’t breathed when Royce stepped in. No words. Just a fist to Green’s jaw. He crumpled.</p>
        <p>"And that’s for sending those tin cans."</p>
        <p>Alicia snapped:</p>
        <p>"Are you insane?! He was a potential data source."</p>
        <p>"He already gave me what I needed. Satisfaction."</p>
        <p>"Fantastic," she hissed. "Now we carry him. Guess who gets the job?"</p>
        <p>She kicked the unconscious body. No reaction.</p>
        <p>Sighing, she turned to the terminal.</p>
        <p>"One dangling, one groaning, one mannequin. And we’re still data-less. Let’s move, boys. Before the cleanup crew arrives."</p>
        <p>Fingers flew across the keys. One hand still on her gun. Like it belonged there.</p>
        <p>Max approached.</p>
        <p>"We should go," he said.</p>
        <p>"When I’m done," she replied. "Not leaving empty-handed."</p>
        <p>"What’s the plan?"</p>
        <p>"Live longer, learn more."</p>
        <p>A pause.</p>
        <p>"For now—watch the cans. If one flinches, act lethal."</p>
        <p>She glanced back. A glint in her eye.</p>
        <p>"And please stop rescuing me. I’m starting to think you enjoy it."</p>
        <p>Max nodded. No words.</p>
        <p>She was already back at work. Like nothing had happened.</p>
        <p>Royce nudged Green’s body aside.</p>
        <p>"You jumped through a window and lived. Fine. Stay. Might come in handy."</p>
        <p>Max gave a quiet nod. His hand still trembled from the blast. His back throbbed. But he was here. And he wasn’t leaving.</p>
