        <h1>Chapter 7. The Birth of the Dynamic Spatial Field</h1>
        <p>Maxim stood at the control panel, gazing at the graph of the latest experimental session. On the screen, oscillations appeared as thin lines, resembling the breath prints of space itself. At first, he couldn't quite grasp what had changed compared to previous recordings, but an inner intuition suggested that something new had appeared in these oscillations. Order where there was once chaos. A hint of an emerging structure.</p>
        <p>Professor Blinov paced the laboratory, hands clasped behind his back. He always walked like that when he was deep in thought. From time to time, the professor stopped at a terminal, entered new data, then again stared for a long time at the screen with the graphs.</p>
        <p>Finally, he froze and quietly called out: "Take a look…" Blinov displayed an updated graph on the large screen. "Do you see these repeating peaks? The intervals between them are almost equal. Almost, but not quite — there's a barely perceptible phase shift."</p>
        <p>Maxim quickly moved closer and stared at the oscillogram. "Is this… not instrument interference? Not just noise?" he asked uncertainly in a whisper.</p>
        <p>The professor slowly shook his head, not taking his eyes off the screen. "No, this isn't about interference. This is precisely a phase shift," he explained in a low voice. A restrained excitement resonated in his tone. "We are no longer simply observing a standing wave. Look closely: oscillations of different modes overlap and begin to form a boundary where they converge. Space itself behaves here like… a spatial surface."</p>
        <p>Maxim froze, as if forgetting to breathe. "You mean…" he began, his voice cracking with excitement.</p>
        <p>"Exactly," the professor replied, almost whispering, and in that whisper, a reverent amazement could be heard. "We didn't just amplify the signal. It seems we managed to create a stable pattern — a structure that persists in time. You see, this is no longer just a wave. This is — a field. For the first time, we managed to excite a localized strain in the fabric of space, and it holds, it doesn't disappear, it doesn't immediately dissipate like an ordinary wave."</p>
        <p>The professor slowly traced a finger in the air, as if outlining an invisible form. Maxim imagined one layer of oscillations sliding over another, slightly out of sync with its rhythm.</p>
        <p>"Imagine several translucent planes superimposed on each other," Blinov continued inspiredly. "Each such layer is an oscillation with a slightly different frequency. Together, through interference, they create a zone of stability. More simply, by overlapping, waves dampen movement in some places and amplify it in others, forming a stable pattern. If we learn to control this zone and modulate its properties, we will be able to create local fields according to our design. Fields that are capable of interacting with matter."</p>
        <p>Maxim felt a warm wave of excitement rising within him. His heart pounded faster with each second — the professor was confirming what he had barely dared to hypothesize.</p>
        <p>"This goes beyond theory…" Max exhaled, his eyes gleaming. "So, we can try experimentally…"</p>
        <p>The professor turned to him. For the first time in a long while, a genuine delight flickered in Blinov's eyes. "Yes, Maxim," he said softly, his voice trembling. "It seems we are witnessing the birth of a controllable field. If our field is truly stable, we are one step closer to a force the world has never seen."</p>
        <p>At that moment, Max felt the air in the laboratory thicken, saturated with a subtle tension, and a thin vibration seemed to hum around him — as if space itself was responding to their discovery… or perhaps it was his own blood trembling.</p>
        <p>The professor broke the silence first, stepping back to the terminal. "I already have a rough draft of the algorithm ready," he said, swiftly gliding his fingers over the touch keyboard. Lines of code and parameters lit up on the screen. "Want to run it yourself?"</p>
        <p>Maxim took a deep breath, gathering his thoughts, and nodded. "Of course, I do," he replied firmly.</p>
        <p>"Then let's proceed," Blinov motioned Maxim to the main console.</p>
        <p>Max sat down at the control panel and entered a few final commands, checking all parameters once more. The algorithm written by the professor struck him with its elegance: not a single superfluous calculation, only the most essential wave frequencies, their superposition, and the supposed final effect. Everything was meticulously thought out.</p>
        <p>"Ready?" the professor asked, placing his finger on the confirmation key for launch.</p>
        <p>"Ready," Maxim almost whispered in response and pressed the launch button.</p>
        <p>A moment — and new graphs flashed on the monitors. Three independent signals with barely distinguishable frequencies began to accelerate simultaneously. Now these oscillations interacted not separately, but synchronously, superimposing on each other. The system reacted instantly: the lines on the graph shot up in a sharp surge — a brief resonance occurred — and then smoothly leveled out. The waves seemed to adjust to each other, entering a common rhythm.</p>
        <p>"Look!" Max exclaimed, not taking his eyes off the screen. "They… are entering a stable phase!"</p>
        <p>The professor nodded, also captivated by the projection of the graphs. The oscillation lines on the screen now fluctuated synchronously, practically superimposed.</p>
        <p>"There it is… the spatial surface," Blinov whispered after a few seconds. "A layer of tension in space, fixed by the intersection of waves."</p>
        <p>Maxim shifted his gaze to the auxiliary visualization screen, where the image from the field sensors was automatically streamed. On it, a faint flickering glow appeared in the laboratory air. The boundaries of this spot were blurred, but discernible: it seemed as if the thinnest membrane or a smooth film was forming right in the middle of the room. It could not be seen with the naked eye under normal conditions, but sensitive equipment detected the presence of this invisible spatial surface.</p>
        <p>"It… holds," Maxim whispered with his lips only, afraid to frighten away the miracle. "Twenty seconds already…"</p>
        <p>"Twenty-one," the professor immediately echoed, watching the timer and readings. His eyes were wide open. "It's not disappearing. The field is stable."</p>
        <p>Goosebumps ran down Max's spine. He saw only the running lines of the graph and the numbers on the screens before him, but he perfectly understood what these data meant. They were witnessing the birth of a new phenomenon. This was no longer just a wave — it was a human-created stable structure in space itself.</p>
        <p>The professor tore himself away from the instruments and turned to Maxim, who noticed that Blinov's hands were trembling — from excitement that he could barely contain.</p>
        <p>"Now we don't just have a standing wave," the professor said softly, emphatically. "We have a real spatial surface. And if our calculations are correct… we will be able to change the properties of this surface — direct it, bend it, make it interact with objects as we wish."</p>
        <p>Maxim nodded, stunned, realizing the scale of the discovery. Ideas whirled in his head. Suddenly, a thought struck him, making him straighten up.</p>
        <p>"Professor!" he exhaled and quickly grabbed the first thing he could find on the table — a light plastic ballpoint pen. "We need to check how this surface interacts with matter. Let's try to carefully place at least this pen on it. What will happen?"</p>
        <p>Blinov raised his eyebrows in surprise, but almost immediately smiled knowingly. His voice remained outwardly calm: "Well… Most likely, the pen will simply float in the air if you carefully let it go. Just be careful. Don't throw it — place it."</p>
        <p>Maxim was already feverishly entering parameters on the control interface. "I'll set the height about fifteen centimeters above the table, leave the field radius the same…" he muttered to himself, setting the right numbers. "Done. Visually, everything is almost as before, invisible… except for a slight shimmer in the air at the edges."</p>
        <p>"That's how it should be," the professor quietly confirmed, not taking his eyes off the readings. "The waves have converged. The spatial surface has stabilized at the set height."</p>
        <p>Max slowly approached the area where the invisible field membrane hung. Right in front of him, slightly below chest level, was what appeared to be empty space — no glints, no shadow, nothing unusual. But, squinting and looking from a certain angle, Maxim discerned a thin curved line in the air, as if a transparent glass edge had outlined itself. At this spot, light rays seemed to deviate from their straight path for a fraction of a second — a barely noticeable mirage, betraying the presence of a boundary.</p>
        <p>Maxim cautiously extended his hand with the plastic pen clenched in his fingers over the designated spot. His heart nearly leaped from his chest. He hesitated for a moment, feeling his lips dry, then, holding his breath, he unclenched his fingers. With utmost care, he released the pen precisely where, according to calculations, the invisible field surface was located.</p>
        <p>The pen… did not fall. It hung suspended in the air, as if an invisible hand had caught it. Maxim stopped breathing. For a second, time stopped for him: the blue plastic pen hung in the middle of emptiness, without any support — and did not fall, defying all laws of nature.</p>
        <p>"It's holding…" he finally breathed out, his voice a broken whisper.</p>
        <p>"It's holding," the professor echoed, his voice filled with reverence. "For the first time in history, we are observing an artificially created spatial surface, formed not from matter, but from the very fabric of space."</p>
        <p>They stood side by side for a few seconds, not taking their eyes off the invisible support on which the pen rested. It seemed as if even the instruments in the laboratory hummed quieter than usual, yielding to the solemn silence of the moment.</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, the pen trembled. Barely noticeable — as if an invisible breeze had gently pushed it. Then, overcoming its initial inertia, it slowly crept sideways. At first, the movement was almost invisible, but gradually the pen gained speed, sliding along the invisible plane.</p>
        <p>"It's not wind," Max immediately commented, carefully watching the object. His voice contained amazement mixed with delight. "It seems our surface is slightly tilted."</p>
        <p>"True," Blinov nodded, not taking his eyes off the pen. "No matter how hard you try, achieving perfect horizontality is almost impossible: there will always be a microscopic tilt. And there's no friction — so it slides."</p>
        <p>The pen continued to glide smoothly, subtly changing direction, as if choosing the path where the field's incline was even slightly greater. Describing a wide arc around the invisible center of the field, as if obeying an unknown force, the pen moved towards the edge of the invisible platform. The moment it reached the field boundary, space there visibly trembled — a faint shimmer flickered, as happens when a light wave reflects off an invisible obstacle. The field's boundary briefly manifested itself as a faded, flashing outline.</p>
        <p>"Did you see that?!" Max exclaimed. He sharply turned to the professor.</p>
        <p>The professor slowly nodded. When he spoke, his voice was strained with the excitement he had just experienced: "Yes… I saw it. The edge of the field. That very reflection. That's what a boundary looks like — a transition between space bound by the field and free space around it."</p>
        <p>The next moment, the pen finally broke away from its invisible support and fell onto the table, bouncing cheerfully and rolling across the ordinary wooden surface. The sound of its fall sounded surprisingly mundane.</p>
        <p>Max sank into a nearby chair, feeling his legs give way. He stared, stunned, at the emptiness where their incredible creation had just hovered.</p>
        <p>"We… just created something that exists in no textbook," he finally said quietly, choosing his words. He looked up at Blinov. "It's not matter and not a field in the usual sense. It doesn't just interact with objects… It sets its own, new mode of interaction with reality."</p>
        <p>"You're right," Blinov replied just as quietly, still looking at the plastic pen, which now lay on the table like the most ordinary thing. The professor shook his head, realizing what had happened. "This is not gravity and not electromagnetism… A completely different class of phenomena. We are creating a boundary that simply did not exist in nature before."</p>
        <p>Maxim slowly nodded and, as if afraid of his own words, barely audibly uttered: "We’ve created a barrier impermeable to matter. Which means… no external force can get through, either."</p>
        <p>The professor remained silent for a long time, not taking his eyes off the fallen pen. Finally, he looked up at Max. In Blinov's usually calm features, amazement, even a reverent fear of the possibilities that had opened up, could be read. When the professor spoke, his voice was deeply resonant: "It turns out we are no longer just studying waves, Maxim… We are beginning to create reality ourselves — to draw it in our own way."</p>
        <p>The next morning, Max jumped out of bed as if he hadn't slept at all that night. Energy overflowed him, and it seemed the new day was specifically created for great deeds. He put on a fresh shirt, hastily buttoning it up. Glancing in the mirror and noticing a wide smile on his face, Max even quietly laughed with overflowing happiness — and almost ran out of the apartment.</p>
        <p>On the way to the university, he walked with a springy, broad stride, shoulders squared. Maxim constantly found himself smiling at his own thoughts. Images of yesterday's triumph—the pen hovering in the air, the professor's radiant face, the trembling graphs on the screens—kept recurring in his mind. Even the cloudy morning sky couldn't spoil his mood. On the contrary, the gray clouds now seemed brighter than usual to him, as if the world around him had changed along with his new attitude. After what he and the professor had managed to achieve, reality itself felt alive and pliable.</p>
        <p>Today, they were to continue creating the impossible — step by step, changing the fabric of reality with their own hands. But there was another thought that made Max's heart beat especially joyfully. Today was Tuesday. Tuesday! And that meant — morning lab session with Alicia.</p>
        <p>Max arrived at the auditorium first. In anticipation, he prepared everything for the class: connected the projector, set up the necessary equipment, scrolled through the presentation slides. Everything went smoothly, not a single hitch. Only the main thing was missing — her. Alicia.</p>
        <p>He glanced at the clock. Five minutes past the scheduled start time, and Alicia was still not there. Max tried to distract himself with work: he began explaining the theoretical part of the new lab to the students. However, he couldn't help himself — his gaze involuntarily kept sliding to the auditorium door. No one behind the door. Emptiness.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes… Alicia was already ten minutes late.</p>
        <p>Max tried his best to remain calm and not betray his growing anxiety. On the surface, he almost succeeded, though his voice became drier and stricter than usual, and his customary smile disappeared. Finishing the theoretical exposition, he somewhat nervously picked up the attendance register — he needed to mark those present. Hope still flickered: maybe Alicia had quietly slipped into the auditorium unnoticed?</p>
        <p>"Alicia Veil?" his voice sounded a little more official than he would have liked.</p>
        <p>Silence. The pause stretched, and finally, from one of the front desks, an uncertain answer came: "She… wasn't seen at the university this morning."</p>
        <p>Max froze for a fraction of a second, staring at the student list where her name was. As if the bright sunny day in his soul had suddenly darkened. He found it difficult to breathe, he lost his power of speech, and the thought, clear a moment ago, slipped from his mind. Blood pounded in his ears. Alicia didn't come… Why?</p>
        <p>Somewhere from a back desk, another voice chimed in, hastily adding news that made Max snap back to reality: "Her guard wasn't seen either. Usually, he's on duty by the auditorium."</p>
        <p>A guard… Max even blinked in surprise, processing these words. A guard! So, that tall guy he had seen several times with Alicia wasn't her boyfriend at all, but a bodyguard. Not a young man, but security!</p>
        <p>"A bodyguard — not a boyfriend… that changes everything!" a thought flashed in his head, and with that spark, the colors of the day suddenly returned.</p>
