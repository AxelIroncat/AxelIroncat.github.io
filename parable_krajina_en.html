  <h1>The Parable of Krajina</h1>
  <p>Once upon a time, on a small planet somewhere in the vastness of the universe, there lived a small tribe. Around 200 heads — including children and the disabled. The tribe called itself different names at different times, but lately, whenever it gathered, it called itself the UN.</p><p>It was a wild tribe, but only because it was young. Just barely forming the beginnings of culture.</p><p>And a leader had just begun to emerge — not even fully formalized yet, but clearly the best hunter and provider, so the others listened to him more than to anyone else. His club was special — a nuke-club. The rest of the tribe feared that club deeply, for if it hit you once, it could kill or maim. The leader’s name was Merikos.</p><p>To be fair, the cleverer members of the tribe watched him closely and figured out how to make nuke-clubs for themselves. But there weren’t many of them.</p><p>And since even seasoned Merikos feared those clubs, an unnatural balance of power and semi-free exchange prevailed in the tribe. Fights became rarer — who wanted a nuke-club to the face? Although, in lean years, they still sometimes ate those who didn’t have one.</p><p>One day, another tribesman decided to shake up the fragile semblance of order. His name was Moskovit. Not the sharpest spear — still young, inexperienced, and not much of a hunter. But he knew where to find oil, which the tribe valued, especially the neighbors. And he had a knack for digging out shiny stones the tribe also liked.</p><p>Most importantly, Moskovit had inherited a nuke-club from his old man. Rumor had it, it was even bigger than Merikos’s. Some distant folks even waited in secret for the day the old man and Merikos would clash their clubs. But the old man never made it — maybe he was sick, maybe Merikos slipped him something — who knows? Either way, the nuke-club passed to Moskovit. A terrible power, but what to do with it — that was another story.</p><p>So Moskovit wandered the tribe, scheming, brooding. His eyes often landed on his younger sister — Kraina. She had long bloomed past puberty into a rare kind of beauty. Maybe not the tribe’s top beauty queen, but young, strong, full of life — and very well proportioned, front and back.</p><p>But Kraina didn’t like Moskovit much these days. Rumors floated that Merikos had been sneaking into her hut under the cover of night. No one could confirm it — the tribe was always gossiping. But Moskovit heard it too. Whether he believed it or not, his hatred for Merikos only grew — and so did his desire for Kraina.</p><p>The tribe, as mentioned, was still young and uncivilized. Incest didn’t bother many, but they had at least agreed: no one takes a wife by force. Marriage was still barely developed — there were polygamous unions, same-sex pairings, even no-ceremony one-nighters. Kraina, knowing the rules, kept refusing Moskovit. And the more she refused, the more he wanted her. The more he wanted her, the more he hated Merikos.</p><p>Then, one cloudy morning at the end of winter — still night by tribe reckoning — Moskovit decided to declare Kraina his wife. And if anyone dared object — well, that’s what his father left the nuke-club for.</p><p>Kraina, meanwhile, had long been gazing toward the untraditional family next door. They called themselves Gayrope. They had other names for themselves, of course, but the tribe knew: if they showed up with songs, flags, and a list of demands — it was definitely Gayrope.</p><p>There were about thirty of them. What they did in their strange household — no one really knew. Rumors only. But the more Kraina wanted to join Gayrope, the less she wanted anything to do with Moskovit.</p><p>So when he barged into her hut before sunrise, smiling and proud, she slammed a club right into his crotch. Moskovit was shocked. He hadn’t expected that. And where had Kraina gotten a club? From Merikos? Thank the spirits it wasn’t a nuke-club.</p><p>The tribe gathered. They condemned Moskovit. And that was it.</p><p>What else could they do? He had a nuke-club. Sure, they pitied Kraina — but Gayropean faces were closer to their skin. And Moskovit had oil and shiny stones. Very useful.</p><p>So, for fairness, the tribe agreed with Merikos: they’d toss Kraina clubs of varying sizes so she could defend herself. And sometimes a bone with scraps of meat, so she’d have the strength to keep fighting. But not too much. If she got too strong — Moskovit might take offense. And if he took offense — who knew? He might grab the nuke-club. He was... a little unstable.</p><p>That’s also why no one gave Kraina any nuke-clubs. Or anything long, for that matter.</p><p>Talks were attempted. Peace offerings proposed. But it was pointless. Moskovit’s pride was wounded. He’d made a vow — he would take her, no matter how. And Kraina, her honor inflamed, vowed: he’d have no peace until he left and cleaned her hut’s floor.</p><p>So it became routine: Moskovit came by night to demand her. She, bruised and bleeding, fought him off with everything she had.</p><p>The tribe got used to it. At first, it suited them.</p><p>Merikos rubbed his hands. If Kraina kicked Moskovit hard enough, he might drop the nuke-club — and then Merikos could snatch it.</p><p>Gayrope didn’t mind either: let her weaken Moskovit. Maybe even break a leg. He’d be more compliant, sell oil and gems cheap. And to keep her going — they promised to let her join their family... someday. Promises cost nothing.</p><p>But the constant attacks didn’t weaken Moskovit. They made him tougher, sharper. His pressure on Kraina increased. But still — she wouldn’t surrender.</p><p>From the top of the hill, Old Chin watched. This was perfect. The more Moskovit fought with Merikos and Gayrope, the more he’d listen to Chin. He was young. He’d obey. Soon, Chin could aim him wherever he liked — at Merikos, or Gayrope. Profit either way.</p><p>Merikos sensed it. He extended a friendly hand: 'Be friends with me instead. I’ll make Kraina hand you her hemispheres. I won’t give her clubs. If she misbehaves — no more bones.' All while scheming to snatch her braid — just in case.</p><p>Gayrope panicked. What if Moskovit gave up on Kraina and turned on them? Quick — promise her everything. Just make sure she keeps resisting.</p><p>...And Kraina? What of her?</p><p>Beaten, bruised, with a severed braid. But unbroken.</p><p>She shouted she’d be free — even if it meant the grave. She struck with sticks at nuke-clubs. She bit into the darkness so that the morning wouldn’t belong to Moskovit.</p><p>She believed, young and naïve. Believed that if you said 'no' — someone would listen. That if you asked for help — someone would come. That if they promised — they would keep their word.</p><p>The tribe watched. The tribe sympathized. The tribe stayed silent.</p><p>Sometimes, they tossed her a gnawed bone — not from pity, but to quiet their conscience.</p><p>Sometimes, someone muttered: 'Maybe it’s her fault?' Then went to sleep.</p><p>Only the elders by the fire whispered: 'We once had a heart... and it stayed with Kraina.'</p><p>And there she stood — barefoot, bloodied, wounded. With a short braid. At the doorway of her hut.</p>
