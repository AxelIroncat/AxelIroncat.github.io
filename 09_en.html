    <h1>Chapter 9. Beyond Theory</h1>
    <p>The spring morning broke through the laboratory window: soft light fell on the blackboard covered with formulas and the instruments scattered across the table. Steam rose from a freshly brewed cup of tea. Max thoughtfully looked at the screen displaying wave visualizations and quietly said: "I never thought we'd come this far..."</p>
    <p>He leaned back in his chair. His gaze was an intricate mix of weariness and excitement, as if he were peeking at the secret mechanism of reality itself.</p>
    <p>The professor sat opposite him: his back straight, but his posture betrayed a certain tension. Taking a sip of tea, he slowly said: "This is only the beginning, Max. The deeper you dig, the more often you stumble not upon answers, but upon new questions."</p>
    <p>Max nodded, though his thoughts were already feverishly assembling a new design.</p>
    <p>"I was thinking..." he began uncertainly, and yet decided to voice his idea: "What if we assemble a miniature version of the generator, with limited power?" He looked up at the professor. "Just to test how the field behaves dynamically, on a single, isolated object. One object, one vector of influence."</p>
    <p>The professor didn't reply immediately, studying Max's face for a while—it wasn't even the words that mattered to him, but the expression with which he had uttered them.</p>
    <p>"Portable?" he clarified, narrowing his eyes.</p>
    <p>"Yes. Nothing superfluous: just the main unit, a stabilizer, and a couple of sensors. All of it—in a palm-sized casing. Of course, only for testing and only in the laboratory. I've calculated the schematic: power consumption can be reduced by about four times."</p>
    <p>The professor silently put down his cup. "And why do you need this?" he asked directly.</p>
    <p>"Movement," Max replied curtly. "So far, we've kept everything static. But in reality, nothing stands still—not even waves. I need to see how the field reacts to the displacement of the source, to a variable load. Otherwise, we'll remain stuck in theory."</p>
    <p>The professor remained silent for a few seconds. "You want to accelerate what should develop gradually," he said softly, staring intently at Max.</p>
    <p>"I want to understand," Max replied calmly. "Carefully, under control. But with my own hands, not just on graphs."</p>
    <p>The professor again looked intently into his eyes. There was no harshness in his gaze, but the weight of past mistakes could be felt.</p>
    <p>"You haven't yet faced the true consequences," he said quietly. "So far, everything is going according to plan and seems controllable. But take one step aside—and you'll be controlling nothing. Are you ready for such a risk?"</p>
    <p>"Ready," Max said firmly.</p>
    <p>The professor sighed softly, then bent down to a cupboard, took out a flat metal box, and placed it before Max. "Here's the blank for your unit," he said sternly. "Only laboratory tests and only under my supervision. Not a single extra assembly, not a single experiment without recording all parameters. And not a word to anyone. Am I clear?"</p>
    <p>Max carefully took the box. His voice unexpectedly dropped to a whisper: "Thank you..."</p>
    <p>"You're welcome," the professor barely smiled at the corner of his lips. " This isn’t a playground. We do science here. We seek limits — and we find them where no one expects. "</p>
    <p>He stood, walked to the screen, and turned off the projection. "And limits," he added, "are rarely found where you expect them."</p>
    <p>Max remained silent. He already knew where he would begin.</p>
    <p>He stayed in the laboratory late. The professor left around six in the evening, saying goodbye: "Don't rush. Everything must be precise."</p>
    <p>He didn't rush.</p>
    <p>Max sat staring at the schematic, but his thoughts drifted further. He understood: the idea of a portable generator was not just a step sideways. It was something personal. He couldn't explain it—but he felt: he needed this device. He needed it like an extension of his hand. Like his own tool. His own power.</p>
    <p>Since childhood, he had wanted to touch the very essence of things. To understand them. To control them. To touch with his finger the boundary between the possible and the impossible.</p>
    <p>Perhaps that's why he so yearned to assemble this unit. Because it wasn't just an experiment. It was—an opportunity. To do what no one else had done. To draw a line—and cross it. To reach out to the fabric of the world and say: "I am here. I am acting. And this is my will."</p>
    <p>Laying out the parts on the table, Max first took hold of the casing—a simple alloy, serving as a shield against external fields. Inside, he carefully placed a compact core, a stabilizer, and a removable control module with a basic program. Not a single superfluous element, not a single accidental jumper.</p>
    <p>Max worked with focus, almost mechanically—but in every movement, there was confidence. He was assembling not a toy, but a tool. His first true tool.</p>
    <p>When everything was ready, he double-checked the entire circuit—and only then connected the power.</p>
    <p>"Contact," Max whispered quietly.</p>
    <p>At first—nothing. Only a slight trembling of the air, as if over hot metal. Then—a faint, barely perceptible resistance as he passed his palm nearby.</p>
    <p>Max placed the mini-generator on the table and set new parameters. After switching it on, he watched the emerging field intently: everything went according to calculations—the surface curved into the shape of a concave hemisphere.</p>
    <p>He took a small metal ball from the shelf and carefully lowered it into the invisible hemisphere.</p>
    <p>The ball rolled from side to side, as if across the bottom of a large wine glass.</p>
    <p>Max looked at the readings on the tablet: no field jumps, no overloads—everything within normal limits.</p>
    <p>"Well... it works, then," he muttered to himself.</p>
    <p>He slightly increased the power. The ball bounced a couple of centimeters and continued to jump, the bounces decaying noticeably slower than if it had bounced off glass or even steel.</p>
    <p>"If we replace the ball with a field too, we'll get a perfectly elastic collision."</p>
    <p>Suddenly, a chill ran down Max's spine. The thought emerged on its own, alien and daring: if the field could toss a ball like that... then perhaps he could make himself jump like that ball?</p>
    <p>Max switched off the power. The field disappeared. The air became normal.</p>
    <p>He looked at his hands—they were trembling slightly. Not from fear, but from the surge of realization.</p>
    <p>The air was filled with the smell of cooling coffee and heated plastic. Max sat on the floor, leaning his back against the cupboard, with the tablet on his knees. His eyes were red, tired, but still attentive—he hadn't slept all night.</p>
    <p>Nearby on the floor lay the disconnected generator. On the tablet screen—neat graphs: resonance, phase, consumption. All clear.</p>
    <p>The door creaked. The professor entered the laboratory and paused at the threshold, squinting. "You've been here since last night?" he asked, surveying Max and the disarray around him.</p>
    <p>Max nodded silently, then stood up and handed the professor the tablet. "I did it," he said hoarsely. "The field is stable. It holds objects at a distance, without touching. There's initial control."</p>
    <p>The professor took the tablet and quickly scanned the data. His eyebrows met at the bridge of his nose—not from displeasure, but from intense thought.</p>
    <p>"Stability confirmed?" he asked quietly.</p>
    <p>"Three hours of tests," Max stated. "Minimal overheating, consumption normal, system behavior—strictly according to calculations."</p>
    <p>The professor was silent, then slowly looked up at Max. "Do you understand what you've just done?" he asked softly.</p>
    <p>Max smiled wearily. "A small step, for now."</p>
    <p>"Yes, a small one," the professor echoed. "But in a direction where every next step—is already without turning back."</p>
    <p>He walked to the generator lying on the floor, bent down, and ran his fingers over its ribbed casing. "Did you try increasing the field density?" he asked, without turning around.</p>
    <p>"No," Max replied honestly. "Decided to hold off on that."</p>
    <p>"Wise," the professor nodded curtly and sat down on a high stool.</p>
    <p>Both were silent for a few seconds. Then the professor spoke: "I remember, when I first told you about such fields, you probably imagined shields, barriers... in short, fantasy?"</p>
    <p>Max smiled at the corner of his mouth. "Something like that," he admitted. "Now—everything's different."</p>
    <p>"And that's good," the professor nodded gently. "True understanding comes when the romance fades. When only work remains... and responsibility."</p>
    <p>Max took a step closer; his voice became almost a whisper: " You always knew this was within reach, didn’t you… " he said. "Even then, when you told me about standing waves in space, you understood what would happen next."</p>
    <p>The professor did not answer for a few moments. Finally, he said: "I hoped I would live to see this discovery not alone. But I wasn't sure if anyone else would have the patience and intelligence to go this far. You surprised me, Max. And with that... you've complicated everything greatly."</p>
    <p>"Why?" Max asked quietly.</p>
    <p>"Because now I can't just tell you: stop," the professor replied tiredly. "You've already crossed the line."</p>
    <p>Max nodded slowly. "Then let's go further... together."</p>
    <p>The professor looked into his eyes for a long time. Then he stood. "Good," he said quietly. "But no improvisations and no euphoria. We still know too little about what we're playing with."</p>
    <p>Max nodded again. "Agreed," he said just as quietly.</p>
    <p>He tried to ease the tension with a smile: "You do realize that for such a discovery, you'll surely get a Nobel Prize?"</p>
    <p>The professor chuckled, but there was no amusement in his smile. "Perhaps," he replied without enthusiasm. "But now is not the time to think about that."</p>
    <p>"Yes, I understand," Max laughed, waving his hand. "It's just... Can you imagine how much can be done with such a field? Lifting loads, creating energy shields... even revolutionizing construction!"</p>
    <p>"You're young, you think the world is a playground for experiments," the professor interrupted him tiredly. "But such technologies never remain in the hands of scientists. Sooner or later, they are taken by those who see them only as a tool of power."</p>
    <p>Max turned away, biting his lip, but his enthusiasm did not wane. He understood that the professor was right, yet he still felt something more in their discovery than potential danger.</p>
    <p>"Then we'll be careful," he concluded quietly.</p>
    <p>The rain had recently stopped. The city hadn't cooled down yet. Moisture still lay as a thin film on sidewalks and glass shop windows, reflecting the dull light of lanterns. The air was warm, thick, smelling of wet concrete, old dust, and overheated oil. Somewhere ahead, in the shopping street area, there was the scent of fried meat, sweet dough, pickled ginger, and fish—a faint warm wind carried these smells mixed with humidity and the acrid smoke absorbed by the asphalt.</p>
    <p>They walked silently. Heels clacked sharply. Over puddles—a short click. On dry ground—a dull thud. Evenly, like a metronome.</p>
    <p>He was behind. Not close, but at the right distance. As always. Like a habit.</p>
    <p>The shopping street they crossed was almost empty. Stalls were closed, shutters lowered, only in one open window a grill still smoked. Warm light streamed out and illuminated the steam rising from sewer grates. Faded flags hung above the stalls, fluttering in rare gusts of wind. It smelled of spices, fried squid, and wet paper.</p>
    <p>They turned. The alley was short and dark, as if specially built to disappear. There were no signs, no people, no movement. Puddles at the curbs reflected rare patches of light, and old, peeling walls smelled of decay and time. Water stood longer here. The air was cooler.</p>
    <p>On a bench by the wall, someone was sitting. A man. Large. A coat. A hat.</p>
    <p>He sat motionless, as if fused into the bench, as if everything around was a set, and he—an anchor, left by someone in this place.</p>
    <p>He noticed him immediately.</p>
    <p>When they drew level, the man slowly raised his head.</p>
    <p>He removed his hat—a neat gesture, as if from another century.</p>
    <p>His voice sounded muffled, almost a whisper, but clear: "Your Majesty."</p>
    <p>She didn't stop. She didn't change her rhythm. She gave not the slightest external sign of reaction.</p>
    <p>Almost.</p>
    <p>He, walking behind, barely caught it: either an instantaneous tension in the air, or a slightly sharper step, or a barely noticeable movement of her shoulder. So subtle that it could have been mistaken for an an interference in perception.</p>
    <p>They walked another ten meters.</p>
    <p>"Who was that?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"A  local lunatic ."</p>
    <p>She didn't turn around. She didn't slow her pace.</p>
    <p>Her heels still sounded impeccably—a sharp click on wet ground, a dull thud on dry, like bone hitting stone.</p>
    <p>He looked back.</p>
    <p>The bench was empty.</p>
