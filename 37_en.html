        <h1>Chapter 37. Back at the Hideout</h1>

        <p>Lis sat on an old crate by the wall, her leg swinging absentmindedly. The air in the hideout was tense, yet laced with the weight of relief. They had made it out. Her father was here. Max was alive…</p>
        <p>And still, the bitterness clung to her, like smoke after a fire—refusing to lift.</p>
        <p>Richard, though clearly worn down, sat upright, leaning against the torn-up couch. He rubbed his temples, slowly pulling his thoughts back into focus. Lawrence stepped in from the corridor, crossed the room, and clapped him on the shoulder with a crooked grin.</p>
        <p>“Damn good to see you, old friend.”</p>
        <p>Richard gave a faint smile.</p>
        <p>“And you, Adam. I was beginning to think I’d never see friendly faces again.”</p>
        <p>Lawrence nodded, but before he could say more, Lis looked up. Her eyes were sharp now—cutting through the silence.</p>
        <p>“Dad… You do know we were betrayed, right?”</p>
        <p>Richard frowned, puzzled.</p>
        <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
        <p>Lawrence shot a glance toward the locked door leading into the side room.</p>
        <p>“Better if you see it for yourself.”</p>
        <p>He crossed the room, pulled a keycard from his pocket, and swiped it over the scanner. The lock gave a mechanical click.</p>
        <p>Lis’s fists tightened as the door creaked open—and Green stepped out slowly, like a man walking to his own sentencing. He looked haggard, hollow-eyed. Guilty. Almost too tired to beg for anything.</p>
        <p>Richard’s eyebrows shot up—but only for a second. Then came the realization.</p>
        <p>“Adam… are you saying—”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” Lawrence said, quietly but firmly.</p>
        <p>Green still hadn’t raised his eyes. When he finally did look up, Richard was already watching him with a gaze that cut straight through.</p>
        <p>“Is it true?”</p>
        <p>Green gave a slow nod. His voice was barely audible.</p>
        <p>“…Yes. I did it. I turned you in.”</p>
        <p>Lis jumped to her feet.</p>
        <p>“You hear that, Dad? He admitted it!”</p>
        <p>Richard didn’t speak right away. His eyes remained locked on Green.</p>
        <p>“Why?”</p>
        <p>Green tensed, his fists clenching at his sides. He looked like he wanted to disappear—but knew silence would only make it worse.</p>
        <p>“They had everything. All the cards. I thought… I hoped I could buy some time. Find a way to help. But all I did was make things worse.”</p>
        <p>He finally raised his head.</p>
        <p>“You don’t know what they do to people who don’t obey.”</p>
        <p>Richard gave a bitter nod.</p>
        <p>“Oh, I do.”</p>
        <p>Lis crossed her arms tightly.</p>
        <p>“You’re not actually going to defend him, are you?”</p>
        <p>Richard sighed and turned to her.</p>
        <p>“No. But I know what it’s like to be caught in a moment where there are no good choices.”</p>
        <p>Then he looked back to Green.</p>
        <p>“You’re out of options now. If you want to make it right—fight them.”</p>
        <p>Green nodded slowly.</p>
        <p>“I understand.”</p>
        <p>Lis turned away, her jaw clenched. The distrust in her eyes hadn’t softened one bit.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know if I’ll ever trust him.”</p>
        <p>Richard shook his head.</p>
        <p>“Give him a chance. We’ve all made mistakes we can’t take back.”</p>
        <p>Lis said nothing.</p>
        <p>Just then, the door creaked open again. Royce stepped inside, dragging a half-conscious man behind him.</p>
        <p>“Who’s that?” Green asked, eyeing the figure in the combat suit.</p>
        <p>“Mikhailo. Terrorist,” Lawrence answered. “He’s staying in your old room for now.”</p>
        <p>A heavy silence filled the space, broken only by the wheezing breath of the prisoner.</p>
        <p>Then—three sharp, familiar knocks on the outer door. Coded. Intentional.</p>
        <p>Lis immediately turned. Lawrence drew his pistol from the belt without hesitation.</p>
        <p>And then—Max stepped through the door.</p>
        <p>Before anyone else could react, Lis rushed him. Her arms closed around him so fast and tight he flinched from the pressure on his bandaged arm.</p>
        <p>“Thank god you’re alive!”</p>
        <p>Max gave a tired smile, returning the hug one-armed. But there was no real joy in his eyes.</p>
        <p>“You’re hurt…” Lis stepped back, her voice caught in concern.</p>
        <p>“Not as badly as I could’ve been. Thanks to Master Yamaguchi,” Max replied. He kept his voice level, but the strain in it was clear.</p>
        <p>“You think I’d have left you behind if I didn’t know Yama-san was watching you?” she said with deliberate innocence, blinking up at him.</p>
        <p>Max couldn’t help but be struck again by how easily this girl could shift between moods—sharp, sarcastic, sincere—and how all of it was real. No pretense. No disguise.</p>
        <p>But now wasn’t the time for admiration.</p>
        <p>He moved deeper into the room, scanning the familiar faces: Royce, drawn but upright. Richard, pale but alive. Lawrence. Green—not in a cell. Everyone was here.</p>
        <p>“Something happen?” Lawrence asked, picking up on the tension in Max’s expression.</p>
        <p>Max said nothing. He opened his hand.</p>
        <p>With a dull metallic thud, Steiner’s blade-sword dropped onto the table.</p>
        <p>“They made the Professor talk.”</p>
        <p>The room went dead quiet.</p>
        <p>Lawrence exhaled and looked away.</p>
        <p>“They broke him…”</p>
        <p>Lis’s hands curled into fists.</p>
        <p>“So what now?”</p>
        <p>Max slumped onto the nearest crate. His voice came out flat.</p>
        <p>“Now we’re nearly out of options. The war’s almost lost.”</p>
        <p>Lawrence nodded toward the side room.</p>
        <p>“Mikhailo’s locked up. Green’s on Vale’s watch.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe Mikhailo can help clear the Freedom Legion’s name… and mine,” Lawrence added, looking at Max.</p>
        <p>Max gave a faint nod. He didn’t care anymore.</p>
        <p>“God… I’m dead on my feet. I need to sleep.”</p>
        <p>He stood, gave one last look to the room, and disappeared into the shadows of the hideout.</p>

        <p>She knew he had come here to meet her.And of course, he had chosen one of the city parks.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was time to speak about what came next.</p>
        <p>Above, in the canopy of wet branches, dozens of fireflies flickered—more than usual. Too many.Where did they all come from, in the middle of a city?</p>
        <p>He stood completely still in the shadows, between two ancient oaks.Motionless. As if carved from stone.</p>
        <p>She approached from behind—more quietly than silence itself. Almost.</p>
        <p>“Do you think he’ll find a way?” he asked suddenly, as if speaking to no one in particular.His voice was pensive. It was the kind of moment when a blow could have been struck.</p>
        <p>She hadn’t expected to sneak up on him. Not him. Not here.</p>
        <p>“If we haven’t found a way until now,” she replied, her voice moving between the trees like a melody—beautiful, but edged with steel,“then it’s only because he wasn’t here before.”</p>
        <p>He nodded slightly.</p>
        <p>“I’ll trust your instinct. The stakes are too high. And there’s too little time.”</p>
        <p>“The old man’s here too. Why?” she asked, tilting her head slightly.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” he admitted. “Maybe he’s still following that path he always talks about.But it’s one more sign your instincts haven’t failed you.”</p>
        <p>He looked up into the treetops, his eyes drawn to the fireflies glinting in the canopy above.</p>
        <p>“Which leaves one last question.”</p>
        <p>She stopped and turned to face him fully.</p>
        <p>“What is it?”</p>
        <p>“Which side will he choose?”</p>
        <p>She burst out laughing—light and crystalline, like wind through leaves.</p>
        <p>“Oh, that’s one thing you don’t need to worry about,” she said, her tone bright but certain.“He’ll choose the right side.”</p>
        <p>Then, her voice turned serious, grounded.</p>
        <p>“I know you both far too well.”</p>
        <p>He didn’t reply. His eyes remained fixed on the fireflies, still glittering above like watchful stars.</p>
        <p>“Then I’ll begin preparations,” he said finally. “We’ll need every ounce of strength.”</p>
        <p>But she was already gone.</p>
        <p>The sharp, rhythmic echo of her heels faded into the distance, swallowed by the park’s shadowed paths.</p>
