        <h1>Chapter 44. Into the Lion’s Den</h1>

        <p>The roar of the metropolis drowned out everything.Crowds spilled into underpasses, flowed across intersections. Electric cars hummed, heels clicked, screens flickered—ads, news, exchange rates. Someone was yelling into a phone. Someone was rushing into the subway. Someone was carrying coffee without looking down. This was the business heart of the megacity: glass, steel, reflections. Speed and indifference.</p>
        <p>Max walked fast. He wore a dark coat, a mask, and a hood. Tinted lenses concealed his eyes. His face was neutral.</p>
        <p>Beside him, keeping pace, hurried Alicia. She too wore a coat and mask, though hers was stylized, and her bright hair was hidden under a black leather cap.Royce followed a few paces behind, silent but watchful, never letting them out of sight.</p>
        <p>"Once again, I’m asking you not to come with me, Lis. And try to talk this brute out of it, too. If the mission succeeds, you won’t be of much help. And if it fails..." Max hesitated. "I can’t risk your life. You matter too much to me."</p>
        <p>Lis, as always, remained unfazed and adventurous."Yeah? And who’s going to save you from giant killer robots?"</p>
        <p>Max clenched his jaw but kept his voice calm."I have one chance. Just one. Iris needs me. Me alone. She might not even agree to speak to anyone else. Only I might be able to get close to her."</p>
        <p>"You think she’ll just let you in?"</p>
        <p>"I think there’s a chance. But if the three of us show up—she’ll likely shut us out completely."</p>
        <p>He spoke quietly, almost in a murmur."You won’t make me stronger. You’ll only raise the threat level. I have one advantage she might not expect. And we’re out of time."</p>
        <p>"I don’t care," Alicia shrugged. "I’m not about to miss the fun part."</p>
        <p>Max gave up."I take it there’s no talking the big guy out of it either?"</p>
        <p>"You know him. Fighting is his favorite pastime."</p>
        <p>Before them, just around the corner, rose the tallest building in the city—Cairo’s main headquarters. It didn’t merely tower—it ruled the skyline.A mirrored monolith, as if grown into the sky, blotting out the clouds.Its facade didn’t reflect the world—it consumed it, refracting it into cold geometry and control. With every step closer, the structure seemed to grow heavier, pressing down on them with its sheer mass.</p>
        <p>"Now that’s oppressive..." Alicia muttered dryly.Max noticed her eyes darting across the reflective surfaces, seeking some kind of anchor. She was nervous. They all were.</p>
        <p>Max said nothing.He knew there would be no second chance. Everything he’d worked toward had narrowed to these final steps.</p>
        <p>The lobby greeted them with ringing emptiness.Silence and sterility.The receptionist paled, her fingers flitting feverishly across the keyboard, eyes wide with barely contained panic. A security guard was already stepping forward, handheld scanner in hand.</p>
        <p>Max handed him the documents, looking him straight in the eye."We’re here to see Iris Tanaka. She’s expecting me."</p>
        <p>The receptionist froze like a glitching terminal. She reached for the phone—but never got a word out.</p>
        <p>One of the walls flared with light.A massive screen flickered to life, flooding the lobby with a harsh glow—and filled with a face.</p>
        <p>A face known across the country.</p>
        <p>"Let them through. Immediately," came Iris’s voice—calm, glacial.</p>
        <p>The girl flinched and nodded quickly."F-first elevator, top floor... the button’s already unlocked," she stammered, nearly shrieking.</p>
        <p>Max didn’t pause.He, Alicia, and Royce walked past her toward the elevator.The receptionist clutched the phone to her chest like a lifeline.The guard stood frozen.The screen went dark—but its afterglow still trembled on the wall like a phantom threat.</p>
        <p>There was no one else in the lobby. No employees. No visitors.Just a row of black planters with artificial trees—decorations of emptiness.</p>
        <p>Alicia glanced up at the towering ceiling and frowned."Disturbingly empty... I feel like a mouse that just walked into the cat’s den on purpose."</p>
        <p>Max nodded.Inside, everything was pounding from the tension.What unsettled him most was how easily they’d been let through.</p>
        <p>The elevator doors slid open silently.Max stepped in first, then Alicia and Royce. No one stopped them. No one checked them. No one asked a thing.A smooth, barely noticeable acceleration.</p>
        <p>"They don’t even care what we’re carrying?" Alicia whispered, folding her arms to steady the tremble in her fingers.</p>
        <p>Max looked at his blurred reflection in the polished wall of the cabin."Exactly," he whispered back.</p>
        <p>If no one tried to stop them, it meant they were sure he wouldn’t succeed.</p>
        <p>And yet, in that confidence—there was something off.As if they weren’t expecting a man.But an event.An experiment.</p>
