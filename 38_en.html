        <h1>Chapter 38. You’ll Let Me Down Too, Won’t You?</h1>

        <p>The professor ran his hand over the perfectly smooth surface of the lab bench. The laboratory was immaculate: all white, glass, machinery—like something out of a catalog where even every potential stain on the wall had been calculated and annihilated. Here he had everything a scientist could dream of: the most powerful instruments, assistants, unlimited resources. Even his mind functioned differently now—sharpened by the neuroimplant, whose translucent calculations tickled faintly at the back of his skull. In under a minute, he could now compute what used to take days and sleepless nights.</p>
        <p>But there was no joy. No pride. Only a void.</p>
        <p>Everything felt alien. Mechanical. As if someone had installed a new brain but forgotten to include desire. Science no longer brought pleasure. Sensations were muted—and even the brilliance of his own work left him indifferent, as if it belonged to someone else.</p>
        <p>He couldn’t remember the last time he’d truly felt anything: the thrill of discovery, the anxiety before a test, even the fear of failure. It had all been wiped away, like emotions scrubbed from memory, leaving only formulas behind.</p>
        <p>Only one memory still burned bright— <i>her</i>.</p>
        <p>Then the door opened—and Iris stepped in.</p>
        <p>At once, everything inside him tightened like a drawn string. Life snapped back into focus—harsh, terrifying, but real. He didn’t just feel fear anymore. It was everything—panic, longing, a desperate hunger to be seen, to matter. Like the emotions weren’t even his, but they surged through him too quickly to be questioned. She gave him purpose just by walking into the room.</p>
        <p>Her stride was measured, smooth, predatory. A perfect huntress. Every movement radiated control, and her voice—when it came—was steel wrapped in silk.</p>
        <p>“They killed him.”</p>
        <p>The words were quiet. But each one hit like a jolt of electricity.</p>
        <p>“Friedrich was the only one who never let me down.” She stopped, fingers flexing inside her thin leather gloves. “And now… he did.”</p>
        <p>The professor froze. He didn’t dare look up. Only now did he realize that his fear wasn’t just for his own skin—it was the fear of disappointing <i>her</i>. Of falling back into that numb emptiness where nothing lived but pain and guilt. He couldn’t explain what bound him to her—was it fear? Reverence? Or just a desperate grasp at the last flicker of something <i>alive</i> inside him?</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, he could no longer analyze it. Being near her meant life returned—twisted, strained, ready to shatter at the smallest glance. But life nonetheless.</p>
        <p>“Will <i>you</i> let me down too?”</p>
        <p>The question was calm. Almost casual. But inside, everything clenched into a hard knot.</p>
        <p>His voice trembled—not from fear alone, but from something else that came with it: urgency, awe, an unbearable need to justify his existence in her eyes.</p>
        <p>“Wh-what? Never! I’m entirely on your side!” His voice cracked, and he caught himself, forcing control back into it. “Everything is proceeding as planned. Production has already begun—the first batch of armor will be ready by morning.”</p>
        <p>It wasn’t him speaking. It was a tool begging to be useful.</p>
        <p>Her eyes lingered on him longer than he wanted. Then she nodded.</p>
        <p>“Good. I expect your people to complete the first batch of armor by dawn—upgraded with your field systems. My soldiers will need it soon. The second phase of the plan is already underway…”</p>
        <p>She stepped closer.</p>
        <p>Her movements grew slower, more deliberate. Like a predator before the pounce. Gone was the usual frost—replaced by the faintest smile. Not warmth. Satisfaction.</p>
        <p>He almost said it—not everything was tested, not yet. But her eyes landed on his—and the thought evaporated.</p>
        <p>She stroked his head with one gloved hand, like petting a stray cat that had finally found shelter. He didn’t move. His heart clenched with a strange, almost painful tenderness—so unexpected it made his vision dim.</p>
        <p>Warmth flooded through him. He remembered something… something ancient. The feeling of safety in early childhood, when the world was nothing but soft, glowing light.</p>
        <p>This was like that.</p>
        <p>But different. Everything in him now existed for her. For her approval. Her whim. And he wanted <i>nothing</i> else.</p>
        <p>He knew he <i>should</i> be afraid. But along with the fear came relief. She was here.</p>
        <p>And suddenly, everything made sense again.</p>
        <p>Her voice softened—but within that softness lurked danger, the way a predator might purr before the kill.</p>
        <p>“You’ve grown used to the neuroimplant already? This isn’t just a limited model. It’s a prototype. Not even the billionaires or the entire Council will get one of these. Only those who <i>truly</i> deserve it. You should be proud of your worth. You’re useful to me—as you should be.”</p>
        <p>And somehow, he <i>was</i> proud.</p>
        <p>He hadn’t asked for the implant. They’d just installed it. But if <i>she</i> said this was right—then it was. As long as <i>she</i> was pleased.</p>
        <p>“If you only knew…” she added softly, still stroking his hair. “How much it costs to keep everything under control.”</p>
        <p>It sounded like a secret. As if she had just trusted him with something no one else was allowed to hear.</p>
        <p>Then she turned. Left the lab as quietly as she’d entered.</p>
        <p>He remained motionless, listening to the fading echo of her steps. Only when the door closed did he wipe his sweating forehead.</p>
        <p>The lab became alien again. Lifeless. The implant resumed its quiet hum—feeding him data, equations, logic. But it felt like the whir of a fan in an empty room.</p>
        <p>What truly resonated was her last look. Her words. Her will.</p>
        <p>Everything else was just white noise—endless, meaningless hum.</p>
        <p>He stood at the bench, and only now realized: the life he remembered—joy, fear, fatigue, even inspiration—was gone. Dissolved in the endless need to meet her expectations.</p>
        <p>He had become the master of this lab. But not of himself.</p>
        <p>Now, he was the shadow of his own genius. A vessel of someone else's will. And all that remained of anything real—was the dull, aching hunger for a self he had long since lost.</p>
