        <h1>Chapter 41. Back in the Trap</h1>

        <p>A tense silence filled the room. All eyes were on Max."Why should we leave?" Royce asked sharply.Max took a breath, trying to find the right words."We’ve walked right into a trap. They were waiting for us."Richard frowned."What do you mean?""When we came to the Correction Center, it turned out to be an ambush. We barely made it out alive. But there were only two people left there—you and Mykhailo. The rest had been ‘transferred.’ You were left behind because we came for you. But why would they leave him?"</p>
        <p>Max slowly turned his head toward Mykhailo."As long as he’s here, he can’t testify to anything," Royce said quietly. Then, a little guiltily, he added:"I scanned him for bugs. It’s hard to transmit signals from underground—sensors would’ve picked it up.""Yes, if the bug was active," Max said. "But if it’s triggered manually…"</p>
        <p>Everyone looked at Mykhailo again.He suddenly smiled—unnaturally, like a predator."But you were ready to testify against the Corporation. They tortured you…" Richard began."They told me I could say whatever I wanted," Mykhailo interrupted. "It doesn’t matter anymore."</p>
        <p>For a moment, a suffocating silence fell."I won’t fail her again. Never again…" his voice was hollow, as if he’d fallen into a trance.</p>
        <p>And then he lunged forward.Mykhailo grabbed a can opener from the table, spun around, and lunged at Lawrence. It all happened in a split second. Lawrence staggered back but couldn’t dodge the blow.</p>
        <p>And then Green stepped in front of him.There was a sickening squelch as the blade punched through ribs and fabric.Green gasped and, swaying, grabbed Mykhailo’s wrist. Their eyes met—there was something strange in Green’s. Not fear. Recognition."You…" was all he managed to whisper.</p>
        <p>Mykhailo wrenched his arm free, pulling the knife out. Green staggered, took a step back—and collapsed to the floor.</p>
        <p>Everything froze.Then chaos erupted.</p>
        <p>Royce moved first. His fist crashed into Mykhailo’s temple with a sickening crunch, knocking him out cold.Lys let out a cry and rushed to Green."Green?! No, no, no! Hold on, please!"But he no longer heard her.</p>
        <p>Lys clenched her fists, staring at Green’s body."He redeemed himself… for his betrayal," she said at last, quietly but firmly."Later," Max snapped. "Grab only what we need. We have to get out."Royce gave a quick glance to Mykhailo’s unconscious body."What about him?""We leave him. In Corporation hands, he’ll wish we’d killed him."</p>
        <p>They didn’t waste time. Weapons, ammo, documents—only the essentials.Royce dashed through the corridor, pounding on doors."Anyone still here—get moving! We’ve been found!"</p>
        <p>From side rooms, resistance members emerged—some already armed, others dazed and disoriented. They followed Max, moving through the dark metro tunnel toward the abandoned outlet into the storm drain system.</p>
        <p>But as they neared the exit, visor lights flashed ahead.A Corporation advance squad.They were too late.</p>
        <p>This time, Max didn’t see the fields—he felt them. Strong. Many.Their commander stood at the front. His voice was loud, commanding, the voice of a man used to obedience."Surrender now and you’ll be spared. Resist, and—""And what?" Lys tilted her head. "You’ll take us to the barracks? For a dance?"</p>
        <p>She stepped forward—lightly, almost carelessly. Came right up to the commander, as if ready to whisper in his ear.He didn’t move. Shields on. Armor in place. Let her babble.</p>
        <p>Then Lys’s leg swung up in a perfect upward arc, her heel crashing into his chin. As if a heel could damage military armor. Especially armor with a prototype Corporation shield.But this heel had its own agenda.</p>
        <p>There was a thunderous thud.A built-in repulsion pulse activated.</p>
        <p>The shield on the commander’s helmet couldn’t block the impact of another directed field. The helmet flew off—and with it, the entire armored body lifted into the air and slammed to the ground.</p>
        <p>"Wha…?" one of the soldiers exhaled.</p>
        <p>"Don’t worry," Lys purred, rising onto her toes. "That was just the first dance step.""Lys, wait!" Max called.</p>
        <p>She didn’t look back but paused. Tilted her head slightly—and at that moment, the hilt of a sword flew over her shoulder. She caught it midair.</p>
        <p>"You actually built it?!" she said in genuine surprise."Sorry," Max stepped forward, "I was saving it for a grander entrance. But you’re always one step ahead."</p>
        <p>Lys had already activated it. A thin blade of energy ignited—glowing with an unusual pink light, dangerous yet… mesmerizing."All right, boys…" she drawled, scanning the soldiers. "Let’s see how your shields hold up."</p>
        <p>She stepped forward. The blade flicked through the air—a pink arc like a whip.</p>
        <p>The first one got hit on the thigh—angled so precisely, the cut looked almost artistic. His armor’s shield flared like lightning and disintegrated in patches. He screamed, grabbed his leg, and stumbled back.</p>
        <p>The second was bolder. Tried to flank her. Lys lunged forward, veered to the side, then struck—the pink blade sliding across the back plate of his armor like a brushstroke. Not deep, but loud and sharp. He dropped into a squat, clutching his rear."Seriously?" Lys scoffed. "Guess your armor’s tough, just… not everywhere."</p>
        <p>She spun around, eyes scanning for the next.The other two froze.</p>
        <p>They’d been told nothing could penetrate these shields. They’d tested the fields with their best cutting tools. But the strange pink blade in this girl’s hand… left them no chance.</p>
        <p>"Anyone else want to test shield penetration?"Max chuckled from the side."I just meant to deliver a gift. But she prefers field testing."</p>
        <p>One soldier jerked, reaching for his rifle. Lys tensed, ready to strike."Stand down, Higgs!" the other soldier’s voice cracked with tension. He stepped forward, shielding his comrade. "I’m not losing another partner to his stupidity.""But Sergeant Drake, sir, we have orders!" Higgs froze with his rifle halfway up."That order isn’t worth your life," the other said hoarsely. "Did you see how she moves? I’m not sure you’d hit her. But she’d hit you, no doubt. Ask the lieutenant."</p>
        <p>He nodded toward the sprawled officer on the floor.Higgs hesitated.</p>
        <p>"And look at the people she’s protecting," Drake continued. "A ragged handful. Exhausted, scared, lost. These are the enemies of the Corporation?"</p>
        <p>He turned to Lys and her companions. Bitterness crept into his voice:"The vaunted new protection didn’t work. Know why? Because the Corporation doesn’t care about us. We’re meat. Disposable tools. Just like the so-called criminals. And we’re the bad guys?"</p>
        <p>Higgs said nothing. Drake went on:"I finally get it. We’re just pawns. In a chess game of evil."</p>
        <p>The soldiers exchanged glances for a few long seconds. Then Sergeant Drake said, quietly, almost wearily:"The Corporation can shove their order… I’m thinking about changing jobs. You should too."</p>
        <p>Higgs lowered his rifle, looked at Max, at Lys, at the people behind them."Screw it," he muttered, slinging the gun onto his back.</p>
        <p>The two soldiers turned and walked down the tunnel, not looking back.Lys raised a brow."Smart move. Now get going. Fast. While I’m still in a good mood."</p>
        <p>She winked at Max and, sword at the ready, walked past the commander, still lying motionless on the concrete floor."He’s gonna have a headache?" Max asked."When he wakes up, definitely," Lys nodded. "Though I think he’ll be rethinking his life choices."</p>
        <p>Max called after the retreating soldiers:"Hey, guys, if I were you, I wouldn’t keep wearing that armor. They didn’t tell you, but those experimental fields? They mess with your nervous system. Can seriously harm your, uh… performance."</p>
        <p>The soldiers quickened their pace. Once they were out of earshot, Lys asked with concern:"Max, what don’t I know? Are you speaking from experience? And didn’t you say the fields weren’t magnetic? Or not exactly?""I’m just launching a disinformation campaign. Imagine we win. Your father takes control of the Corporation again. But people already know about dynamic spatial fields. Even if the tech is removed, rumors will linger—of an impenetrable, unknown force field. And if someone cracked it, others will try. The more rumors, the more the truth gets buried.""And why do you think your ‘magnetic’ rumor will spread?""Because I tied it to something they understand—and fear. It’s simple. Memorable. It sticks. And they’ll pass it on."</p>
        <p>"And how did you make the blade pink? I thought that was impossible. Did you do the impossible… for me?""Uhh. Well, if two semi-transparent surfaces reflect light at a distance comparable to the wavelength of a certain color…""Idiot, just admit it was a miracle—for me!""Of course for you. Who else?"</p>
        <p>Max pulled himself together. No time for romance."We’re losing time. We need to move. Who knows how many more are coming."</p>
        <p>Footsteps echoed off the damp walls of the sewer. Max could hear soldiers, coming from different directions, but they weren’t rushing. Probably the deserters had reported that the new shields were useless against the fugitives’ weapons."They’re stalling. Maybe that gives us a chance," Lawrence whispered, leading them forward.</p>
        <p>They reached another narrow hatch.Climbing out, they found themselves at a junction.Pursuers sounded from every direction—except the far-right tunnel."There," Royce pointed.Lawrence spun around."You forget? That way’s blocked!"Royce silently raised his hand.A field amplifier glowed on his glove."We didn’t have a way to clear it before."</p>
        <p>Lawrence hesitated for a moment, then nodded.They dashed to the blockage.</p>
        <p>Max drew the blade and struck the debris. Royce’s glove pulsed, blasting rock. Lawrence joined in—they smashed and tore through the rubble together until the path opened just enough for them to pass single file."Go! Move!"</p>
        <p>Once the last Freedom Legion member had passed through, Max turned and swung the sword one last time—collapsing the tunnel behind them.Stones crashed down.Their pursuers were left on the other side.
