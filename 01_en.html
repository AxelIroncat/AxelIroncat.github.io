        <h1>Chapter 1. The Beginning</h1>
        <p>The spring sun, breaking through gaps in the clouds, scattered glimmers across small puddles on the cracked paving of the university courtyard. The air was filled with the cool, tart scent of damp earth and the first freshly burst buds — the smell of a new beginning.</p>
        <p>Max crossed the courtyard, his fingers sliding over the familiar, rough surface of old stone. The university facade, stern and gray, seemed unshakeable – a keeper of traditions and a place where Max had grown intellectually.</p>
        <p>He walked through the familiar echoing corridors, where the smell of dusty books and chalk mingled with the echoes of hundreds of voices that had sounded there before him. Today, this familiar place felt like a threshold: he was no longer a student... but not yet fully a scientist – still on his way to something unknown.</p>
        <p>He had always been a "why" person. From his earliest memories, when other children played hide-and-seek, he tried to figure out why clouds didn't fall, what a finger was made of — wasn't it rubber? Later, the questions became deeper, almost existential. In school, he quickly realized: textbooks provided answers, but too slowly, and not to the questions that truly concerned him. He didn't want to know what was written in an equation — he yearned to understand why it worked at all.</p>
        <p>He entered the university building with the same feeling a believer enters a temple. He came here not for a profession. He came for meaning, believing: if the world could be understood, then it could be changed.</p>
        <p>And yet... today was different. He stopped before a massive oak door. A postgraduate student, and starting today – Professor Blinov's assistant. This thought evoked a mix of pride and respectful trepidation. Before, he came here for lectures with notebooks; now, as a full-fledged researcher.</p>
        <p>The strap of his bag, stuffed with notebooks and articles, felt weightless. He still couldn't quite believe he would be working with the man he had admired since his first year.</p>
        <p>Professor Blinov was a legend of the faculty. A true scientist who knew how to transform strict formulas into vivid ideas, and dry theories into insights. In his lectures, physics became almost philosophy. Blinov seemed to Max like a man who looked into the very essence of the world, something like a cartographer of reality. Max secretly dreamed of one day making a discovery with him. Today, the dream was beginning to come true.</p>
        <p>He pulled open the heavy door and stepped inside. The laboratory greeted him with the familiar, pungent smell of overheated electronics, old books, and ozone from the instruments working in the corner. Dark shelves lined the walls, filled with thick monographs and stacks of printed graphs. In this visible chaos, the pulse of living science beat.</p>
        <p>He stopped at the threshold, trying to calm his breathing. Professor Blinov sat at a large desk by the window. He seemed so absorbed in his work that he didn't notice Max enter. The floorboards barely audibly creaked. The professor, without lifting his eyes, said in an even voice: "Come in, Max. You're on time." Max walked to the table. "How does it feel?" the professor finally looked at him over his glasses. "Like crossing some boundary, Professor. I'm no longer a student... but it feels like everything is just beginning. I feel... a thrill." Blinov's lips touched a slight smile. "Exactly. Now you work here. Now you are my co-author."</p>
        <p>"Co-author." Max felt a warmth spread within him.</p>
        <p>The professor, meanwhile, turned the laptop screen around. "Look and tell me what you see."</p>
        <p>The screen was almost black, but hundreds of tiny flashes randomly darted across it. "Just interference?" was his first thought. But, on closer inspection, Max felt a chill run down his spine – the flickering was uneven. In the sparks, a subtle hint of rhythm could be discerned.</p>
        <p>"It looks like white noise..." he murmured, "only... there's some structure to it."</p>
        <p>Blinov nodded approvingly. "Right. Now forget everything you knew about space."</p>
        <p>Max leaned forward, feeling a mixture of astonishment and almost sacred dread envelop him: "Even the generally accepted four-dimensional spacetime model?" "That, first and foremost," Blinov confirmed, tilting his head slightly. "I abandoned that model long ago. We are accustomed to talking about four-dimensional spacetime — a convenient mathematical model. But physics is not about how the world is structured. It's about how we are able to understand it — by simplifying it greatly. In reality, time is not like spatial coordinates. I believe time is not a coordinate, but a parameter, rather a scalar. Imagine: in a three-dimensional world, a body has three degrees of freedom for movement and three axes of rotation. Add a fourth dimension — and the number of planes of rotation would immediately increase to six. It turns out that only in three-dimensional space do these parameters coincide — three and three. But in four-dimensional space — four directions of movement and six axes of rotation: symmetry is broken. Many prefer not to notice this conflict between model and reality. But we cannot turn an object or event into a 'time plane,' can we? Nor are we able to move freely back and forth through time. Time has no directions or extent, like length, width, or height — it works differently."</p>
        <p>He paused, giving Max a moment to contemplate this heretical thought.</p>
        <p>"If this is true," a thought flashed in Max's mind with astonishing clarity, "then everything I was taught, everything I believed in, is just scenery."</p>
        <p>But he couldn't help but trust the professor. "I will try to explain my hypothesis. I started small," Blinov continued. "I checked some old data that was previously attributed to instrumental errors. First, I noticed a strange effect when measuring the magnetic permeability of a vacuum. Then — an inexplicable deviation in the electrical constant. Then — a clear failure in the gravitational model. Each time, everything was attributed to different reasons: noise, equipment defects. But I couldn't shake the feeling that nature was sending us a signal, and we were suppressing it! I began to look for patterns. And I found them. There was a common signature in these 'measurement errors'."</p>
        <p>The professor's fingers ran across the keyboard. The image changed: a dense dynamic map, like a swirling sea of multicolored energy. Max involuntarily leaned forward. The picture was mesmerizing.</p>
        <p>"And this is what we get if we stop filtering out these 'signals'," Blinov said. "We used to consider space a void. But I see it differently. I distinguish space as a geometric concept and as a space of interactions. It is an active, dynamic medium. I believe that it is not perfectly homogeneous, but rather pseudo-isotropic – meaning it only appears the same in all directions to a crude observer. Imagine a lake on a quiet day," he began softly. "At first glance, the water is smooth. But throw two stones — and waves will spread from each, creating a complex pattern. So it is with space: from afar, we see only a smooth surface. But if you look closely, you can discern ripples — waves of interactions. After all, the world doesn't have to be smooth just because it's convenient for us."</p>
        <p>"These waves," Blinov continued, "are not like ordinary ones. They do not reflect, nor do they attenuate. Space exists not around matter, but within it — as in a vacuum. Therefore, waves pass through everything: through stone, metal, flesh. We do not notice them not because they are weak, but because everything, including us, is already immersed in them."</p>
        <p>Max watched, unblinking. He was overcome by a feeling of intellectual disorientation, bordering on sacred awe. "You think space itself... undulates?" "Exactly. Something is constantly happening inside it. Spontaneous oscillations, impulses — what I call internal pulsations of the very structure of space. Its oscillations are complex, we don't see a familiar order in them. If you like, imagine an analogue of Brownian motion — but not of particles in water, but of the very foundation of space."</p>
        <p>"This isn't noise..." the thought struck Max. "What if it's the logic of the universe?"</p>
        <p>"So, space is not an inert stage, but an active participant in events?" he whispered. His voice now held not only interest, but also a troubling realization.</p>
        <p>"Exactly. We observe these signals. They repeat. Therefore, there is a system. But what causes it is unknown. Perhaps a relic echo of the very structure of space. Or perhaps..." He paused. "Something greater than we can imagine. This could be dangerous. Knowledge is not always safe. Especially knowledge that undermines foundations."</p>
        <p>Blinov looked at him. The smile was almost imperceptible — tense, without joy.</p>
        <p>Max held his breath. Then, almost involuntarily, he asked the question that had been forming inside him from the very beginning: "Why me? Why did you choose me?"</p>
        <p>"Because you are the only one who always understood not only the formulas, but also the essence," Blinov said quietly. "You always looked for something more beyond the formulas. You felt where the truth was, even if it didn't yet have an equation. That's why you're here." Max lowered his eyes, feeling his face flush. "So, you think I'm... special?" The professor chuckled briefly. "I think you're smart enough not to ask that question, and honest enough to ask it anyway." "And still... what's next?" "Next is observation," the professor said. "We collect data, study, build a model. But," his voice deepened, "if we are right... if space is not a silent stage, but an active participant... Then sooner or later we will need to learn to speak its language. Perhaps you will be able to help us find the first words." Max looked at the screen again. He seemed to discern a pattern in the disordered waves. The professor's idea completely captivated him. He felt a temptation, an almost irresistible urge not just to observe, but to touch, to intervene. "What if we try... not just to passively listen, but to 'speak' first?" he blurted out. "To send a directed signal into this medium and try to find a resonant response?" Blinov smiled with his eyes only, as if he had expected this. "Max," the professor gently stopped him as he was about to elaborate on his idea. "That fire in you — that's what's needed. But remember: patience is often no less important than eagerness. I'm thinking about it. But we need to approach it very carefully. We don't know the scale of the phenomenon. Imagine, you throw a stone into a pond — waves spread in all directions. It's very important not to cause a tsunami because we don't fully understand the scale of the phenomenon." "And now," Blinov turned off the screen, "it's time for tea. Let's go, I'll introduce you to your colleagues in your new capacity. All the faces there are familiar to you. But today, you enter it as a different person." They left the laboratory. Blinov closed the door and, lowering his voice, added: "And yes, Max... don't you dare tell anyone about this yet. Even if you really want to." Max nodded, feeling the full weight and intoxicating allure of the secret he had touched. He did not yet know that he had already stepped onto a path from which there was no simple return, no going back unchanged. The world around him, so familiar and understandable just that morning, now seemed filled with hidden meaning.</p>
