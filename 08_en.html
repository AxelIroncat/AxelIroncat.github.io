        <h1>Chapter 8. Echoes of the City</h1>
        <p>A spring morning in the megalopolis began with a familiar hum: the distant rumble of cargo trucks intertwining with the rustle of thousands of steps on asphalt. From the open doors of bakeries, the tempting aroma of fresh bread and strong coffee wafted, mingling with the smell of damp asphalt after the night's rain. The streets, deserted just an hour ago, were now filled with people rushing to work, their footsteps beating a rhythm. The city breathed, lived, pulsed. In the parks, where the first greenery was already breaking through, the gentle singing of birds could be heard, heralding the imminent arrival of warmth.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Vincent Drake didn't like morning patrols. He preferred the night, when the city quieted down, and shadows became more honest. But today was "Open Visor Day"—another PR campaign by the "Kairo" Corporation, designed to humanize their armored soldiers. Drake, a former special forces operative whose movements in heavy exoskeleton armor were honed to perfection, felt ridiculous. His partner, Corporal Marco Rossi, on the contrary, seemed to relish every moment. Marco was the embodiment of a southern temperament, locked in a steel shell. His visor was raised, revealing a broad, good-natured face with olive skin and thick, curly hair escaping from under his helmet. His dark, lively eyes constantly sought something interesting. He moved in the armor with an unforced, almost dancing lightness, as if it were not a heavy suit of armor, but a part of himself.</p>
        <p>"Sergeant, just look at this!" Marco's voice, amplified by the vox-module, sounded almost like a song. "Isn't it beautiful? The city is waking up, people are smiling…"</p>
        <p>Drake merely grunted, his own visor also raised, revealing a stern, un refreshed face. "They're smiling because we're here, Corporal. And because they were told to smile."</p>
        <p>"Well, that's cynicism, Sergeant!" Marco laughed. "Don't you feel this energy? This smell of fresh coffee and roasted chestnuts? This is life!"</p>
        <p>They walked along one of the central shopping streets, which had recently been an area of "increased criminality." Now, exemplary order reigned here. Shop windows gleamed, advertisements shimmered with all colors, and the rare passersby hurried about their business, casting cautious but grateful glances at the patrolling soldiers.</p>
        <p>An elderly woman approached them, her face etched with wrinkles, but her eyes shone with kindness. She carried a basket of vegetables. "Oh, my sons!" her voice was soft, with a slight accent reminiscent of old quarters. "How good it is that you are here! Before, it was really scary. These bandits… they became completely brazen. My grandson, he was even afraid to go to school. And now…" She sighed with relief. "Now at least one can calmly go shopping. Thank you, dears!"</p>
        <p>Marco smiled broadly, his voice becoming even softer: "We are here to protect you, madam. It's our job."</p>
        <p>"Work…" the woman shook her head. "Before, the police managed. I remember how a strong man walked our block every evening. Everyone knew him, everyone trusted him. And then… where did they all go? As if they dissolved. And these gangs, where did they come from? Yesterday it was quiet, and today they are robbing in broad daylight. My neighbor, poor thing, even had her favorite parrot stolen! Right from its cage!" Drake listened silently, his gaze sweeping over the faces of passersby. Some nodded in agreement with the woman's words, others quickly averted their eyes. He saw in their eyes a mixture of relief and deep, unexpressed anxiety. "Kairo" gave them order, but took something else.</p>
        <p>"Don't worry, madam," Marco said, his voice full of sincere sympathy. "We'll make sure your grandson can go to school safely. And the parrot… we'll try to find it."</p>
        <p>The woman nodded gratefully and walked on, muttering blessings.</p>
        <p>A few blocks later, they were stopped by a middle-aged man in a worn work jumpsuit. His face was tired, but his eyes burned with anger. "Soldiers!" he waved his hand towards a recently renovated building. "Did you see what they did to our cultural center? Broke all the windows, painted the walls… And children used to go there! And where was your lauded police when this was happening? Or do you only show up after everything is destroyed?"</p>
        <p>"We're working on it, sir," Marco replied, trying to remain calm. "Kairo Corporation is deploying all its forces to restore safety to the streets."</p>
        <p>"Safety?" the man snorted. "And who, do you think, should have provided it initially? The state! But it seems to have withdrawn. And you… you're just filling a void. And I'm not sure that's for the best." He shook his head and walked away, his steps heavy.</p>
        <p>Drake looked at Marco. "You see, Corporal? Not everyone is so happy with our presence."</p>
        <p>"They're just scared, Sergeant," Marco replied, but his voice was no longer so cheerful. "They need time to get used to the new order."</p>
        <p>"Or to the new power," Drake muttered to himself.</p>
        <p>As the day drew to a close, the atmosphere in the city changed. Smiles became rarer, gazes—more wary. On public screens, which had still broadcast advertisements and entertainment shows that morning, alarming headlines now flickered: "Escalation of Violence," "Unknown Groups Attack Infrastructure," "Police Call for Calm." Heavy patrols in exoskeleton armor became commonplace on main thoroughfares, their footsteps echoing dully on the asphalt. "Kairo" wasted no time.</p>
        <p>Drake and Marco patrolled one of the old shopping districts. Here, unlike the center, the streets were not so wide, and the alleys—dark and winding. The air was cooler, smelling of dampness and old dust.</p>
        <p>"Creepy, isn't it, Sergeant?" Marco whispered, his voice muffled. "As if the city has died."</p>
        <p>"It's just biding its time, Corporal," Drake replied, his gaze sharp. "This is when the real work begins."</p>
        <p>They turned into a short, dark alley that seemed to have been specially built to disappear. There were no signs, no people, no movement. Puddles at the curbs reflected rare patches of light, and old, peeling walls smelled of decay and time.</p>
        <p>"Sergeant, do you see?" Marco pointed ahead. From the deep shadows of the alley, like phantoms, two female figures appeared. They moved lightly and silently, their silhouettes barely discernible in the semi-darkness. At first glance, nothing threatening. Just two young women, perhaps returning home.</p>
        <p>"Careful, Corporal," Drake muttered, his hand resting on the grip of his baton. The women approached. One of them, tall and slender, with long dark hair, smiled. Her smile was disarming, almost flirtatious.</p>
        <p>"Oh, soldiers!" her voice was soft and melodic. "How nice to see such faces on a night like this! We thought only robots patrolled here."</p>
        <p>The second, shorter woman, with a short haircut and mischievous gaze, giggled. "Yes, my friend and I were walking around, completely forgot about the time. Can we take a picture with you? For history. You're such heroes!" Marco, despite Drake's warning, relaxed. His visor was raised, and he seemed ready for a joke.</p>
        <p>"Of course, ladies! Anything for such beauties!" He even took a step forward to stand next to them.</p>
        <p>Drake felt his insides clench. Too easy. Too fast. He tried to stop Marco, but it was too late.</p>
        <p>"Excellent!" exclaimed the tall woman, her hand darted to her waist. At that same instant, a short, gleaming blade flashed in the air. It was thin, almost invisible, and moved with incredible speed.</p>
        <p>"Marco!" Drake cried out, but his voice was drowned in a hoarse, gurgling sound. The knife went straight into Marco's eye, piercing his open visor. The Corporal twitched. His other eye, a moment ago full of youthful enthusiasm, froze in emptiness. He jerked, and his heavy armor thumped dully onto the wet asphalt.</p>
        <p>Drake roared with rage. He lunged forward, but the second bandit, the shorter one, was already beside him. She darted at him, her hand gripping another knife, aiming for his exposed face. Drake's reflexes, honed by years of training, were lightning-fast. He intercepted her wrist, twisting her arm with a sharp crunch. The knife fell from her fingers and clattered to the ground. The tall woman, seeing her partner caught, did not intervene. Like a shadow, she instantly recoiled deeper into the alley and disappeared into the darkness.</p>
        <p>The red-haired woman hissed in pain, but her eyes burned with wild, insane determination. "This is for the death of my beloved!" she spat, her voice full of hatred. "They were paid to make noise, and then you came to kill them! Who else could it be but the corporation?!"</p>
        <p>Drake tightened his grip on her arm, making the woman cry out. But before he could say anything, or she could say anything more, gunshots rang out from the darkness above. A bullet pierced the night. At that same instant, he lowered his helmet's visor. The bandit flinched. Her eyes widened in a final moment of shock and growing horror as she collapsed, a silent, chilling testament to Kairo's pervasive influence and ruthless efficiency. Her gaze, frozen in death throes, was fixed on Drake, but it contained no accusation, only a bitter, hopeless suspicion: "It's… it's you, bandits…" A few more bullets clanged off Drake's armor, leaving no trace.</p>
        <p>Drake remained standing over the bodies of his fallen partner and the silenced bandit. The shadows of the alley now seemed heavier, more oppressive. He looked at Marco's lifeless face, then at the dead bandit, and the pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place—the "bandits" were not just random criminals; they were part of a larger, provoked conflict. And someone who controlled this conflict didn't want the truth to come out. He looked up at the sky. Surveillance drones silently glided overhead, their red and blue lights the only witnesses to this nocturnal drama. Drake called for backup. His voice was even, professional, but something inside him had changed forever. He was only just beginning to wonder—were they merely pawns in the corporation's game? The night was just beginning. And in its silence, the city's echo was entirely different.</p>
