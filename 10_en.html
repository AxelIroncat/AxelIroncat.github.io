    <h1>Chapter 10. First Steps</h1>
    <p>The laboratory was steeped in silence. Professor Blinov had left for a meeting of the academic council, and Max had a few hours to finally test his own invention. He busied himself with wide straps, securely fastening two compact generators—devices of his own assembly, mounted on wrist-like platforms—to his forearms. The moment had come to see them in action.</p>
    <p>He took a deep breath, approaching a blank concrete wall. "Well, let's see," he muttered, bringing his palms close to the smooth surface. He activated both devices, and before each palm, faintly visible hemispherical surfaces of the dynamic spatial field flickered into existence. The air around them vibrated almost imperceptibly, like a string stretched to its limit. He leaned forward and pressed these fields against the wall.</p>
    <p>The push proved too strong, too smooth. Lacking friction, the hemispheres slid helplessly downwards. His feet skidded backward on the concrete floor, and he, losing balance, dropped to his knees, narrowly avoiding smashing his head into the wall. "Okay... definitely not like that," he grumbled with a wry smile, rubbing his bruised knees. The concrete under his palms felt even colder than usual, as if absorbing his failure.</p>
    <p>Bruised, but exhilarated—he had felt it: the raw power of the field, tossing him like a rag doll. Even if the outcome wasn't what he expected, the fact remained—the idea worked. The power was real, and it was in his hands. He just needed to understand how to tame it and direct it appropriately.</p>
    <p>Rolling onto his side, he sprang to his feet. The problem, he realized, lay in the incorrect vector of force application. What if he tried to brace the fields not against the wall, but against the floor—directing the impulse from bottom to top? This thought seemed logical, and he immediately set to work.</p>
    <p>He took a push-up position—but now resting not on his palms, but on the invisible fields beneath them. The tips of his boots pressed against the floor, and his palms hovered about ten centimeters above the concrete surface—in essence, he balanced on the force fields. The initial attempts to maintain balance were difficult: the smooth force hemispheres tended to slide apart, for there was no friction between the field and the floor.</p>
    <p>Carefully increasing the power, he sent a stronger impulse downwards. At the same instant, the fields under his palms sharply pushed off the floor. His arms were thrown upwards, and his body almost straightened—his heart skipped a beat: could he have done it? But he got too caught up in his thoughts, and his balance was immediately lost—he began to fall forward. Instinctively, he tried to extend his hands, or rather, to catch himself on the fields under his hands. But the invisible supports failed him again: the smooth spheres slid sideways at the most inopportune moment. He did not brace himself and hit his face on the floor. His nose took the brunt of the impact—sparks of pain burst before his eyes.</p>
    <p>He groaned and rolled onto his side, clutching his aching nose. "Good thing no one saw! Especially Alicia. Just imagining her laughing at me made  my  ears flush hot." He hastily dismissed the embarrassing images and returned to the experiment—now was not the time to be distracted. But every time he touched his nose, the pain reminded him of his mistakes, spurring him to greater precision.</p>
    <p>The thrill in his chest only intensified. He continued to experiment, and each thrust, even if it ended in an instant slap against the floor, brought him closer to his goal. Sometimes he managed to feel a clear push—as if an invisible hand was urging him from below. At one point, he managed to hover above the floor for a good second—triumphant, dizzying—before crashing back down. Despite scraped elbows and new bruises, he felt he was on the verge of something incredible.</p>
    <p>He clenched his fists, flexing his aching fingers. It seemed he had almost figured out the right principle, but something was still missing. Maybe it was the synchronization of the fields? Or the angle of his palms when pushing off? He needed to think.</p>
    <p>After catching his breath, he realized: the fields sliding on the smooth floor made movements too unstable. If you direct the force hemisphere straight down, the thrust goes up—that's obvious. But the hemisphere itself is too smooth and slides. What if you change the field's shape? Concentrate the force at one point—make the field a cone, capable of digging into the surface instead of sliding over it? And then it hit him. The hemisphere! The problem was in the geometry of the field. The hemisphere was perfect for creating a barrier, but for a thrust... it was useless. He ran to the table where the control tablet lay.</p>
    <p>His fingers trembled with excitement as he made changes to the settings. A couple of quick commands—and the geometry of the fields changed from dome-shaped to conical. Now, instead of wide hemispheres, the generators created sharp cones directed downwards. Theoretically, such conical fields should grip the concrete more firmly and stop sliding.</p>
    <p>"Let's see..." he whispered, again assuming the initial position and activating the devices.</p>
    <p>This time, the invisible fields under his palms stood firm. The sharp cones of the field dug into the concrete—his palms hovered confidently above the floor, not sliding sideways. Encouraged, he simultaneously sent an impulse to both fields. A surge of force propelled his body upwards. He, with delight, felt himself rise slightly higher than before. He landed on the floor relatively softly, only slightly bumping his already bruised knee.</p>
    <p>"Whoa..." he exhaled, grinning widely and rubbing his bruised knee. "Now this is getting interesting!" He dropped to the floor, catching his breath. But the idea wouldn't let go: what if he added his legs? The sheer audacity of the idea quickened his pulse. He looked at the generators strapped to his arms. He had two more identical units, already synchronized with the main system... A bold plan was already forming in his mind. Insane, perhaps, but retreating was not in his nature.</p>
    <p>"Hover in the air... maybe even jump like that ball," he whispered to himself and resolutely rushed to the equipment.</p>
    <p>From a box under the table, he pulled out two more mini-generators—spare modules prepared for such a case. His hands trembled with excitement as he strapped the additional devices to his legs, just below his knees. Then he quickly connected the new generators to the overall system and carefully checked the settings to ensure everything worked synchronously. The button on his armband allowed all connected modules to be turned on simultaneously. Carefully lowering himself onto his hands and knees, he paused for a moment, gathering his courage, and simultaneously activated all four devices.</p>
    <p>The fields beneath him thrust his entire body upwards. For a moment, his breath caught: he lifted completely off the floor—both his knees and his boots!</p>
    <p>He floated on all fours, suspended as if by some invisible scaffolding. Just the fact of levitation filled him with a giddy euphoria. The next task was to gain full control over his position. He tried to shift his center of gravity, subtly changing the power of the fields. Every incorrect adjustment resulted in a new fall: too strong an impulse to his hands—and he was thrown backward, onto his back; excessive thrust from his legs—and he flew forward, risking smashing his nose again. The laboratory echoed with the dull thuds of his falls and quiet, but persistent curses. But he did not give up.</p>
    <p>"Understood... precise synchronization is needed," he muttered, rubbing a new swelling bump on his forehead.</p>
    <p>Gritting his teeth, he readjusted the power ratio between all four generators several times. A couple more tries—and finally, he managed to find a fragile balance. The fields hummed evenly, holding his body smoothly and steadily. He hovered above the floor, on all fours in the air—as if an invisible force had lifted and was holding him. And he finally managed to jump on all fours, activating the amplified mode of all four fields.</p>
    <p>"Got it!" he exclaimed joyfully and even cautiously wiggled his hand, checking for stability after landing.</p>
    <p>At that moment, the laboratory door sharply swung open.</p>
    <p>"Max, you..." the professor's voice echoed from the doorway.</p>
    <p>Professor Blinov froze, staring at his postgraduate like he'd just witnessed a fish levitating in the middle of the lab. He turned his head at the sound of the voice, and that movement was enough—the fragile balance was immediately broken.</p>
    <p>"Oh-oh-oh!.." was all he managed to gasp; he frantically flailed his arms, trying to regain his balance.</p>
    <p>Too late. The field under one hand lost its support, the second pushed him sideways—and he tumbled head over heels. With a loud smack, he crashed onto the floor right in front of the professor's feet.</p>
    <p>A deafening silence fell in the laboratory. He squeezed his eyes shut in shame and lay there, not daring to move, awaiting his mentor's angry words. Instead, only a heavy sigh was heard.</p>
    <p>"Are you all right?" the professor asked quietly.</p>
    <p>"Seems so..." he moaned, making sure nothing was broken, and rubbing another bruise. He smiled wryly. "I think I just invented the clumsiest way to levitate."</p>
    <p>The professor slowly approached and surveyed him critically from head to toe. The stooped figure of the teacher against the bright ceiling light reminded him of a formidable shadow of reason. Blinov sighed heavily, crossed his arms over his chest, and spoke softly, but sternly: "Max, do you understand that we are doing science here, not  fooling around like schoolboys ? We need calculation and control, not  reckless experiments skirting the edge of danger . We must not forget that any discovery must first be verified and only then safely implemented."</p>
    <p>He guiltily got to his feet, dusting off his jeans. His whole body ached, but deep down, the excitement from his recent success still bubbled. He couldn't resist a smile. "I understand everything, Professor," he quickly said, his eyes burning. "But look yourself, what progress we've made! We've stabilized the fields, learned to control them—and now we're on the threshold of a real breakthrough. This isn’t theory anymore. It’s the start of something real!"</p>
    <p>The professor watched him intently from behind his glasses. Finally, he slowly nodded: "Well... You've certainly achieved a lot," he admitted. "But, Max, you are too obsessed with the practical application of our discovery. I hope you haven't forgotten that we shouldn't reveal our secret to anyone outside, at least until we've studied everything ourselves and are completely sure of its safety?"</p>
    <p>He stopped short, then quietly, but firmly retorted: "Of course, I haven't forgotten. But at least for ourselves, we can explore the practical possibilities, right? Perhaps it will even be useful for the theory itself."</p>
    <p>The professor unexpectedly changed his tone: "Alright... Tell me, rather, how did you manage to eliminate the fields' sliding on the floor?"</p>
    <p>"I changed the shape of the field," he replied. "Instead of a flat hemisphere, I configured it as a cone."</p>
    <p>"Understood..." Blinov surveyed the cracked floor around them and grumbled quietly: "And someone will have to patch up the concrete now."</p>
    <p>Only now did he notice that the entire floor around him was covered with small indentations and scratches from his recent experiments. He blushed with embarrassment. "Vladislav Mikhailovich, I'm sorry... I'll fix everything!" he blurted out, feeling his ears burn.</p>
    <p>The professor chuckled and conciliatorily raised his hand: "By the way, your idea isn't bad at all," he said, now more softly. "If you give the field roughness—essentially, embed a microstructure directly into the force surface—you can significantly improve grip."</p>
    <p>"Embed a microstructure... directly into the field?" he repeated, raising his eyebrows.</p>
    <p>Blinov nodded: "Theoretically, yes. True, implementing such a thing will be very difficult—it will require a new algorithm, precise calculation... However, listen carefully, Max. Just because we can imagine some possibility doesn't mean it needs to be realized immediately. Everything has its time and measure."</p>
    <p>He fell silent, struck by the grandeur of the concept. He couldn't have imagined that a field could be given texture. But the professor had already ignited his imagination—images of the future, so bold that they took his breath away, flashed through his mind. He saw before him a world transformed by their discoveries.</p>
    <p>"Professor, this is a revolution!" he suddenly exclaimed, unable to contain his excitement. "We can transform the whole world. Imagine: transport with such fields—no friction, no wear, no pollution. Flying machines taking off without fuel... Building skyscrapers without accounting for gravity and material resistance... Why, everything around us can be improved!"</p>
    <p>Blinov shook his head and sighed heavily: "You again see our discovery as a panacea," he said quietly. "But you don't see what I see. You don't understand how easily any great discovery can turn... into evil."</p>
    <p>He quieted, feeling his enthusiasm shatter against the professor's weighty arguments. Blinov's words, like a cold shower, washed away the remnants of youthful overconfidence, leaving only a bitter aftertaste. He wanted to object, but the professor continued, stepping to the window and gazing at the gloomy sky: "As soon as our technologies leave the laboratory walls, those who think not of creation, but of destruction, will immediately become interested in them," he said softly, as if thinking aloud. "Look at history. Do you think the spear was invented for war? Not at all. It appeared to hunt, to defend against predators, to make life easier... But history teaches that any new invention inevitably becomes a weapon. Even if we want to use it for good, there will always be those who apply it differently. Bright ideas have more than once turned into nightmares on battlefields."</p>
    <p>He felt the air between them grow tense. While he dreamed of new possibilities, the professor thought of the consequences—and he was right.</p>
    <p>"But if we control everything..." he began uncertainly.</p>
    <p>The professor turned around. His eyes were serious, almost sad. In them, he saw not just weariness, but a deep, unexpressed pain from past mistakes, from the burden of knowledge that turned out to be too heavy. " Control? Max, we’re just two men in a boat, adrift in a storm, with no compass and no anchor.  We have no control. We are not a corporation, not a special service, not an army. We have no leverage. No shield. Nothing but silence."</p>
    <p>He paused and looked directly into Max's eyes: "The only thing we can control is our language and our actions. Ourselves. Tell no one. Show no one. Until we understand what we are truly dealing with. You created these portable devices, believing in science and its benefit to people. I was once like that too. But now I'm afraid that our discovery could turn into great sorrow if it falls into the wrong hands. I worry both for the fate of this discovery and for you, Max. I don’t want your gift to become your downfall."</p>
    <p>He fell silent. He looked at his instruments: a moment ago they seemed like a symbol of boundless possibilities, but now they seemed like a source of hidden threat. He had never thought about it this way before, and the professor's words weighed heavily on his soul. His former euphoria evaporated, giving way to agonizing thoughts about the limits of control.</p>
    <p>His inner fire did not extinguish. Despite the fear and uncertainty, he was still irresistibly drawn to the unknown. Retreating seemed unthinkable. Excitement and anxiety wrestled within him, but now he knew for sure: this new world he had touched had already become a part of him, and there was no turning back. But he didn't want to discuss his doubts with the professor.</p>
    <p>The ward was silent—not sterile, but almost sacred. Semi-darkness. Cool air. The steady hum of life support systems. Everything here was calculated. Even the air—like a formula in which no room was left for chance. As if life itself existed here by temporary permit.</p>
    <p>Iris entered silently. Not because she was afraid to disturb the peace—she was a part of it. She didn't approach immediately, didn't sit down. She simply stopped, hands clasped behind her back, as if on guard.</p>
    <p>He lay, like a sleeping god who no longer needed the world. Pulse—42. Even. Cold. Invulnerable. Like everything he had ever built.</p>
    <p>"You won," she said, not raising her voice. "The world submitted. Resistance is broken. We smoothed out everything that tried to break free. We called it order. And made it permanent."</p>
    <p>She looked at his face. The very one before which ministers bowed, from which enemies turned away. Now it was silent. Not dead—empty. As if burned to the ground, so nothing interfered with its function.</p>
    <p>"I continue your work. I have become what you wanted to make me. Even more. You put everything you had into me. And took something that should be mine."</p>
    <p>She took a step aside. Glanced at the monitor, as if at a mirror. Not searching for a reflection—searching for an answer.</p>
    <p>"Sometimes I think... Maybe everything could have been different. We could have been a family. You—a father. I—a daughter. Laughing, arguing, quarreling over trifles. Not learning to control a gaze at three and commanding adults at five. I could have grown up alive. You could have been happy. Though could you? All your happiness was in achieving power. Why did you give it to me?"</p>
    <p>"Do you remember Mom? They said such beautiful women don't exist. A natural blonde, with cold blue eyes—almost unreal beauty. But you found her, took her from the podium where she shone. Made her sit at home. Then—you took me. They said: I inherited her beauty. I was destined for another life. But you chose for me. Father, you didn't create a family. You created a construction. And you made me its support."</p>
    <p>"Or maybe... all this is a lie? Maybe I'm not as beautiful as she was? Around me—only sycophants. They fear me. And if they didn't fear me—would I see admiration in their eyes? Or pity? Maybe... I would have wanted to be loved. Not feared. But now I'll never know. You determined my fate."</p>
    <p>Pulse—43.</p>
    <p>She walked through the ward. Smoothly, almost silently. Everything here was cleaned to sterile strictness. No books. No photos. No memories. As if he himself had renounced himself—to not be distracted from the structure.</p>
    <p>"But you chose a path. And put me on the same line. You didn't have a son—but you had me. And you made me not an heiress, but a reflection. You didn't teach me love. You taught me power."</p>
    <p>She returned to the bed. "Now I am more than you. My voice echoes everywhere. My name is feared even by those who rule others. I have become not a shadow—I have become the sun. But only because you burned everything that could give me shade."</p>
    <p>She looked at his face. For a long time. Without malice. Without hope. Just—like a daughter who can no longer forgive, but hasn't yet decided to forget.</p>
    <p>"I move forward. Power—is more than control. It's no longer a system. It's—reality. I have become what you wanted, perhaps, to become yourself. Only… sometimes I feel that with each new step upwards, something leaves me. As if the air becomes thinner, and I have to hold my breath not to show weakness. I am still ascending. But the higher I go—the less of myself remains. And more often I don't know—do I wield power, or does it wield me."</p>
    <p>Pulse—43.</p>
    <p>"Sometimes I think you're envious. Would you like to come back—just for a day? To see. To correct. Or to be proud."</p>
    <p>Her fingers touched the panel. On the screen, "Iris Tanaka. Full access" flashed. She didn't input anything.</p>
    <p>"You are alive. You hear. And if ever I allow you to awaken... You must know: I’m not a monster.  I’m the result — of your upbringing, your will… and your greatest mistake. "</p>
    <p>Pulse—42.</p>
    <p>The door closed silently behind her. Like a page closed forever — but never torn out.</p>
