        <h1>Chapter 42. The Formula of Freedom</h1>

        <p>They had escaped again.But was there still a point in resisting?</p>
        <p>Now they were nothing but a pitiful handful of fugitives—tired, wounded, clinging to a single desire: to make it through another day.The world around them—under control. Under Cairo’s rule.</p>
        <p>When people started begging Lawrence for a break, he agreed, exhausted.Max sat down by the wall and pulled a crumpled napkin from his pocket—the very one the professor had once used to jot down a formula. He unfolded it and stared at it.</p>
        <p>The writing was still visible:</p>
        <p>M → F → P → M</p>
        <p>P = F × B</p>
        <p>Resources, or money (M), generate force (F).Force multiplied by belief (B) produces power (P).And power brings in more resources.</p>
        <p>The loop is closed.</p>
        <p>He looked at the napkin, and something rose hot in his chest—not anger. A void.The kind the professor had left behind.God, how he missed him now.</p>
        <p>What would he be thinking in my place?</p>
        <p>Max closed his eyes.</p>
        <p>“What can stand against power?”</p>
        <p>And then he answered himself:</p>
        <p>“Freedom.”</p>
        <p>He looked at the napkin again. With a trembling hand, he added:</p>
        <p>L = l × B₂</p>
        <p>Where L is freedom, <i>l</i> is individual strength, and <i>B₂</i> is belief in freedom.</p>
        <p>That meant belief in power must be <i>B₁</i>. And:</p>
        <p>B₁ + B₂ = 1</p>
        <p>And then he silently decoded it for himself:</p>
        <p>If all belief goes toward power—freedom vanishes.But if there's belief in freedom—there’s still a chance to stand.</p>
        <p>He whispered:</p>
        <p>“So that’s what it comes down to. The good belief—in freedom. The bad—belief in the Corporation’s power.”</p>
        <p>Max looked over the pitiful remnants of the Legion.There were so few of them.Which meant belief in freedom had almost disappeared.</p>
        <p>Their only remaining hope was to surpass the Corporation in strength.</p>
        <p>He glanced at his blade.Only two of them existed—his, and Lis’s pink one. They gave a short-lived advantage over the Corporation’s weapons. But not for long.Never underestimate the professor. He would figure out Max’s idea with the layered fields soon enough.</p>
        <p>Iris had the army.Iris had the resources.They had almost nothing.</p>
        <p>And yet… he knew something about Iris. Maybe even more than she knew about herself.He knew what drove her.Above all, she wanted to increase her power.And now… now she wanted <i>him</i>, to help amplify that power.Not critically, no—but she <i>wanted</i> him.And if she wanted something—she wouldn’t stop.</p>
        <p>That meant he had a chance.</p>
        <p>A chance for what? To kill her?</p>
        <p>He looked up.</p>
        <p>People were sitting along the walls, silent, hollowed out by fear and exhaustion.Even Royce—a seasoned fighter—now looked lost, like all the life had drained out of him.</p>
        <p>Max studied their faces.No resolve left to fight for freedom.Only wounded souls, hoping not for victory, but for survival.</p>
        <p>Only Lis—seemingly untouched by the weight of it all—smiled at her father, light and airy, as if their race with death had been just a stroll.</p>
        <p>Young, radiant…So defenseless against what was coming.</p>
        <p>Max looked at her, and his chest tightened.</p>
        <p>How could he protect her from the darkness creeping through the world, swallowing everything under Cairo’s control?Now, alongside infinite corporate resources, they also had the field technology.Yesterday it was just a prototype in Steiner’s lab—today, every soldier hunting them in the tunnels was shielded by dynamic spatial fields.</p>
        <p>They had found their home.Sooner or later, they would catch up.</p>
        <p>What Max feared most in the world wasn’t for himself.Not for the others.But for <i>her</i>.For this girl made for the light, not fear.For that laughter. That smile.He couldn’t bear to see her world shatter again.Couldn’t let her lose her father—just after they’d found him again.</p>
        <p>He didn’t want the abyss to ever touch her.</p>
        <p>But reason was merciless:</p>
        <p>Their strength was next to nothing.Their chances—paper thin.</p>
        <p>And then it hit him—A crushing weight, like he could no longer carry fear, or pain, or even hope.A thick, sticky emptiness began to fill his chest.As if life itself had exhaled out of him.</p>
        <p>And suddenly he understood:</p>
        <p>This too was belief.Belief in defeat.A bad belief.</p>
        <p>What you believe in—has power over you.Strength is merely an extension of belief. A way to reinforce it.</p>
        <p>Maybe the professor was wrong.His formula worked for large numbers, probably.But in each individual case…</p>
        <p>Belief — that’s the true vessel of power.</p>
        <p>It doesn’t matter whether we believe in what we want—or what we fear.Belief leads us.</p>
        <p>And for that belief, we’re willing to die—because we think it’s the foundation of our world.</p>
        <p>But belief is only a crutch—A temporary substitute for knowledge.</p>
        <p>How do you make people see their belief is wrong—when they’re willing to die for it?</p>
        <p>Strength. You show them a force so immense, their belief collapses.</p>
        <p>But how?</p>
        <p>He fell silent again.</p>
        <p>What’s stronger—belief or strength?</p>
        <p>No answer came.</p>
        <p>Max closed his eyes.Took a deep breath, trying to gather his scattered thoughts into something whole.</p>
        <p>Then, almost absentmindedly, he reached for his blade’s hilt and activated it.The sudden glow of the field lines calmed him—like an anchor dropped into stormy emotional seas.</p>
        <p>What he felt wasn’t just strength.He felt <i>in tune</i> with the space itself.</p>
        <p>As if it was whispering to him.Guiding him toward a truth that lay deeper than all human schemes and conflict.</p>
        <p>Everything around him felt fragile, insubstantial.But the field, born of pure spatial essence, didn’t need belief.</p>
        <p>It simply <i>was</i>.</p>
        <p>Real. Undeniable.</p>
        <p>And then a thought came to him:This—this was the true formula of power.Not the kind politicians fight for.The real one—power over space itself.Over the foundation of reality.</p>
        <p>Whoever unlocks its secrets—will change the world.</p>
        <p>That was the missing piece in his puzzle.</p>
        <p>Truth.</p>
        <p>Too often we mistake belief for truth.Especially when belief becomes ingrained into who we are.</p>
        <p>But belief can never be stronger than <i>Truth</i>.</p>
        <p>Truth exists—with or without belief.</p>
        <p>Max stood up decisively and walked over to Lawrence.The man, glancing over the weary survivors, said hollowly:</p>
        <p>“We’ve got no home left.”</p>
        <p>Max didn’t stop.He already knew what to do.As he passed, he said quietly:</p>
        <p>“Then it’s time to pay someone a visit.”</p>
        <p>“Visit who?” Lawrence asked.</p>
        <p>Max didn’t turn around.</p>
        <p>“To Iris Tanaka.”</p>
