    <h1>Chapter 11. Air Underfoot</h1>
    <p>Max shed his top shirt, checked the fastenings of the portable generators on his forearms and legs, and stepped into the center of the laboratory. The floor was flat, smooth—ideal for tests. He took a deep breath and activated the devices.</p>
    <p>Invisible,  adhesion  force fields instantly formed under his boots,  as if the soles met a textured field of compressed force . Max felt a springy resistance, as if treading on dense air. The field created traction. He carefully took a step, then another. Very soon, he was confidently moving through the air, as if on an invisible bridge. This became his technique: he learned to maintain balance, control his steps, perceiving the fields as an extension of his legs. If he stepped unsuccessfully, the field would falter, but Max quickly learned—catching his balance with small corrective movements,  like a tightrope walker adjusting his every step with micro-corrections .</p>
    <p>" What if I mix smooth and rough modes? " he wondered aloud, feeling his first successes.</p>
    <p>Deciding to test the mode change, Max accelerated and sharply switched the generators to  glide  mode. The traction vanished. His body surged forward, sliding as if on ice, but without deceleration.  He hit the wall sideways with a solid thump, the impact rebounding him like a ragdoll.  He crashed heavily onto the floor, gasping for breath, and groaned, rubbing his bruised shoulder. "You can't fool Newton," flashed through his mind. Without friction, the body would continue to slide forever until it met an obstacle. Max winced: good thing his speed was still low. The school lesson involuntarily came to mind: impact energy increases with the square of speed—double the speed would result in a fourfold impact. He got off with a scare and a couple of bruises. A new challenge lay ahead.</p>
    <p>"So… to stop or change direction, I need to turn on the  adhesion  field again, plant my foot, and try to brake," he muttered, getting to his feet.</p>
    <p>Max picked up speed across the glide field once more.  At speed, he switched one field back to  adhesion  mode and sharply planted his foot, trying to brake. His foot instantly stuck to the floor. Friction returned—and his speed immediately began to dissipate. However, Max's body still moved forward by inertia. The abrupt braking spun him around: his center of gravity lurched forward, past his support, and Max tumbled across the floor sideways, barely managing to brace himself. He expected this: too sudden. It was as if he had braked at full speed with one foot—and that's what spun him around. Similar to how a car might skid when one wheel locks up, his body rotated around his planted foot. Good thing he had deliberately chosen a direction towards an empty wall—there were no instruments there. Max hit his back against the wall, but not too hard. Standing up, he chuckled at his own haste.</p>
    <p>"Softer," he mumbled to himself, dusting himself off.  "Slamming into traction at that speed? A death wish."</p>
    <p>Accustomed to the initial falls, he began to act more cautiously. He again picked up speed—and before braking, he returned the fields to  adhesion  mode smoothly, transitioning from sliding to friction without jerks. It worked better now: rocking a couple of times, he managed to stop in the middle of the laboratory without touching the wall.  He threw a fist in the air—just a small, tired triumph.  Slowly, but he had learned to control this wild transition.</p>
    <p>Encouraged by his success, Max decided to try another technique: jumping by pushing off the force field. He reprogrammed the generators so that the  adhesion  field under his foot would only appear at the moment of contact with the support, not continuously. In essence, he created a pulse mode: the field activates when his foot presses on the surface and immediately deactivates when the push is complete. The first test of this mode produced an incredible effect: now it felt as if there was not a solid floor beneath his foot, but a compressed spring that instantly decompressed and launched him upwards. Each step-push became like a jump: the field elastically pushed his body off the floor, adding impulse to his movement. A couple of quick steps—and Max literally bounded across the laboratory, gaining speed. He cried out in delight. The energy of each push combined with the previous one, increasing his speed and stride length again and again. If the room had been larger, he would have accelerated into a full run with long, leaping strides—almost like on professional running prosthetics. Max felt he could leap across almost the entire room from a standing start.</p>
    <p>However, such power had a downside: the generators began to heat up noticeably, and the charge indicator on his armband quickly dropped. The batteries drained visibly—they wouldn't last long in such an intense mode. Max slowed down, allowing the system to cool. Catching his breath, he muttered, looking around the cramped walls: "Not enough space…"</p>
    <p>More ideas awaited him. He decided to complicate the task: combine jumping and sliding. The plan was this: push forward with the  adhesion  field, and then, while airborne, switch to  glide  mode and slide above the floor for as long as the impulse lasted. Max gathered himself, took a short run, and sharply jumped forward, pushing off the floor with a strong field "kick." Almost simultaneously, he switched the fields to  glide  mode. The plan worked halfway: Max indeed shot forward, sliding above the floor faster than before. But he immediately encountered the same problem as before: the impulse didn't vanish. Without friction, his speed didn't decrease at all. He crossed the laboratory like a meteor and slammed full force into the opposite wall, unable to slow down. For the second time that evening, the walls took a noticeable hit from him. Rubbing his bruised elbow, Max mentally cursed.</p>
    <p>It worked… almost. He could gain speed with huge leaps, but how to turn or stop afterwards? He squatted down and thought for a moment. Turns remained a problem: how to change direction when there's no solid surface beneath you? In the ordinary world, to turn while running, you need to push off your foot sideways—meaning lateral friction force would change your trajectory. Here, hovering on force cushions, any attempt to shift sideways had no effect: his feet didn't grip the floor and continued to carry him straight. Max realized that for control, he would again need traction—at least for a short time, to correct his course.</p>
    <p>He came up with an improvisation: try to slide on one foot, and at the right moment, switch the other to  adhesion  mode, like a brake or a skate, imparting a turn to the movement. The attempt to transform himself into a "figure skater" was partially successful. Max ran and, transitioning to a slide, cautiously switched his right boot to  adhesion  mode, barely touching the floor with it. His foot immediately found purchase and, like a skate blade, began to cut an arc in the direction of movement. He leaned his body and indeed felt his trajectory smoothly change. Almost like a beginner on an ice rink—braking with one foot, sliding with the other. He quickly mastered this technique, executing smooth turns, albeit at the cost of speed. However, the slightest error in angle or concentration led to an instant loss of balance, and Max often slapped sideways onto the floor. At one point, carried away by speed, Max almost slammed into a wall, managing at the last second to activate both supports again and jump, avoiding the impact. The landing was hard: he tumbled across the floor over his shoulder, painfully hitting his back. His heart skipped a beat—had he broken something? No, he was fine. But for a second, he imagined he would actually break through the wall or flatten himself against it, like an insect against glass. At such speed, the slightest mistake could be fatal. Max breathed heavily, lying on the cold floor, and feverishly thought about what else could be done for safety.</p>
    <p>Gradually, he developed a reflex: any hard fall he would soften by extending his palms forward. The generators on his hands would activate at the moment of impact, creating an elastic layer between him and the obstacle. At least the sliding of the  glide  fields on his hands helped prevent his palms from scraping against the floor. Gradually, he also learned to switch modes on his hands intuitively.  Glide  -  adhesion . This immediately sparked a new idea: if the fields on his hands could cushion impacts, then they could also be used to actively push off walls or any surfaces to change trajectory. The main thing was to choose the right angle and not get confused between modes. He stood up, excitedly pacing the room.</p>
    <p>The new idea demanded testing, but… alas, there was desperately insufficient space. Max stopped in the middle of the laboratory. He breathed heavily, trying to cool down a bit after his vigorous experiments. Veins pulsed at his temples, his body trembled with adrenaline. Testing the fields had exhausted him considerably, though more mentally than physically—tension and excitement kept him on his feet. Inside,  his entire being burned with urgency, as if something within him refused to wait.  The device, born in theory, truly allowed him to perform the unimaginable—run through the air, slide faster than the wind, jump beyond human capabilities. Yes, he still often fell and made mistakes, but with each passing minute, he felt the devices better and better.</p>
    <p>At some point, it even seemed to him that the generators had become a direct extension of his body.  He no longer thought about controls—the fields answered like instincts.   It was as if the force had nerves. As if it lived inside him.  He closed his eyes and listened to himself. His heart pounded somewhere in his throat. He wanted to scream. Laugh. Both at once.</p>
    <p>Instead, Max merely whispered, almost inaudibly: " This cage… it’s suffocating. I need sky. "</p>
    <p>He understood that this decision was born not of stubbornness, but of necessity. Here, within these walls, he had reached a limit—further skill improvement was impossible. The cramped room constrained him more than any chains. Every time he accelerated or took an extra step, he immediately hit a wall and was forced to stop. Continuing to experiment within these squares meant sooner or later actually breaking through a wall—or his own bones. The next step required space, real open space, not a room cluttered with equipment. Max took a deep breath.</p>
    <p>An inner voice of reason whispered to him to stop, to think… Professor Blinov had warned him about the curfew and dangers, about the Corporation keeping watch. But the surge of euphoria drowned out the fear. He knew that Professor Blinov would never approve of this venture, but stopping was no longer possible. Max firmly decided: tomorrow night, he would go out into the city and truly test his invention, to its full extent. Today, he already felt exhausted.</p>
    <p>Night fell on the city quietly and imperceptibly. Despite all the professor's warnings, Max couldn't restrain himself—the urge to move forward, to new horizons, outweighed fear and caution. In recent weeks, a strict curfew had been in effect in the city: due to a surge in crime, the corporation had introduced severe restrictions, and after midnight, only patrols and those with special permits were allowed on the streets. Max, of course, had neither a permit nor the right to go out at such a time.</p>
    <p>But the desire to test his generators in real conditions outweighed common sense. Waiting until late at night, when the last colleagues had left the university building, he quietly climbed out of the window onto the roof of the annex, jumped down into the inner courtyard, and then exited through a service gate.  The city slumbered uneasily, its silence sharp as glass.  Empty streets and alleys lay in semi-darkness.  Lanterns spilled thin cones of light that did little to hold back the dark.   Everything looked artificial—like stage props abandoned before dawn.  Max looked around. No cars, no people—only long rows of dark windows, and occasionally in the distance, an conditioner would hum. In this silence, every sound seemed loud, every movement—provocative. His heart pounded with a mixture of fear and excitement, but the city felt alien and hostile.</p>
    <p>Max carefully stepped onto the empty pavement. In the night's silence, even this step echoed hollowly between the facades—as if the city night itself was eavesdropping on a stranger. He held his breath. It was still not too late to turn back… But inside, everything burned with impatience. Max activated the generators, switching them to a new, improved  adhesion  mode with maximum grip. The soles of his shoes seemed to acquire invisible spikes. Now—forward! Max walked faster and faster, getting used to the temporary retention of the field for support. Another step, another…. But he didn't stop there.</p>
    <p>Convinced that he could stand confidently in the air in open space, Max decided to test the opposite mode as well. He slightly tilted his hands, giving a signal—and switched the generators to  glide  mode. The rough resistance instantly disappeared. Now the force fields transformed into smooth air cushions under his palms and feet—they still held him above the ground, but created almost no friction. Max pushed off with his foot and, with a sharp movement, darted forward.</p>
    <p>He glided over the street, rapidly gaining speed. The surrounding buildings blurred into dark silhouettes at the edges of his vision. He felt like he was running on air, pushing off invisible supports with his feet to maintain speed. Almost weightless, he flew forward, barely touching the pavement. The air whistled in his ears. Wind lashed his face, bringing tears to his eyes, but Max didn't blink—the feeling of freedom was too exhilarating. Everything happened like a film: he sped over the asphalt, just centimeters above the surface, weaving between the pale patches of light from the lanterns. With one powerful thrust, he soared across a quiet intersection, flying in an arc and landing softly on the other side of the street. "I'm flying!" flashed through his mind. For the first time in a long time, he felt true power and freedom.</p>
    <p>However, the technology wouldn't let him forget its limits: as soon as Max allowed himself to be distracted by euphoria, the field reminded him of the limits of possibility. One wrong step—and his balance was lost. He had accelerated too much and lost concentration slightly: his center of gravity rapidly shifted forward, moving beyond his point of support. His feet in  glide  mode couldn't grip the air to correct his lean. At such speed, even a small displacement proved fatal for his balance. In essence, inertia threw his body forward, and his legs had nothing to brace against to hold him up.</p>
    <p>Max felt himself falling. Too fast!—flashed through his mind. No time to try and regain traction. His body uncontrollably tilted downwards. A fraction of a second before hitting the ground, Max instinctively threw his hands forward. The generators on his palms reacted instantly: they emitted a powerful burst of field towards the pavement. A dull thud rang out—the force "cushion" partially absorbed his fall, cushioning the impact. Nevertheless, even weakened by the field, the shockwave knocked all the air from his chest. Max slammed hard onto the asphalt, painfully hitting his side, and by inertia rolled several meters, scraping his elbow and side. Stopping, he reflexively rolled onto his feet and tried to jump up, ready to run further. But his legs wouldn't hold—they buckled. He sat down on the ground again, his vision momentarily darkening.</p>
    <p>A breather… just a second… He inhaled with difficulty and, grunting, stood up, leaning against the wall. His knees trembled.  Pain throbbed in his ribs.  For a few seconds, Max just stood there, dizzy, his vision blurred. His chest burned—either from the impact or from the fear he had experienced. Gradually, his breathing normalized, and sensitivity returned to his bruised muscles. Nothing seemed broken. This time—he was intact. He cautiously moved his hand: the generators worked properly, responding to his slightest gesture. Everything was fine, the technology hadn't failed. The field had saved his life, cushioning his fall: without it, at such speed, he could easily have broken bones or fractured his skull. Max exhaled, and unexpectedly a quiet, nervous chuckle escaped his chest. He stood in the middle of an empty street in the middle of the night, alive—and it seemed incredible. More fear than pain.</p>
    <p>Of course, it was reckless… but it worked! His invention withstood the test even in such an extreme mode. Okay, a bruised muscle ached somewhere on his side, his scraped knuckles burned—but that was minor. The main thing was, he had proven to himself that he could control the field even at high speeds and in a critical situation. Another moment—and, remembering that he was standing on an open street, Max quickly darted into the shadow of the nearest doorway. His heart still pounded from the experience. The new ability opened up incredible possibilities for him, but at the same time, it also harbored danger.</p>
    <p>Pressing his back against the cold wall, Max hid, listening. The night around him again stood motionless. Only blood pounded in his ears. He cautiously peeked from around the corner—no one around. No one had looked out at the noise, at least not yet. He could catch his breath. Max swallowed hard, a hot lump in his throat. Either laughter, or a nervous spasm—he didn't even understand himself. In this flight on the edge, he felt omnipotent… but any mistake could cost too much. A few seconds of euphoria were enough for him to almost lose control and get himself killed. He needed to stop immediately before things went too far. He realized that for today, it was enough. Continuing the experiment now would be madness. Max took a deep breath, trying to calm down. His head buzzed from the experience, as if a motor had started inside.</p>
    <p>He looked up at the dark facades around him. In every black window, he imagined an observer. How much time did he have before a patrol descended upon him? Professor had warned him: the corporation was vigilant, and any unauthorized activity, especially technological, would immediately attract their attention. And indeed—could such a noise have gone unnoticed? The clang of his fall, his own exclamation… The danger now was far more real than a few minutes ago. Max straightened up, painstakingly stretching his aching back, and was about to make short dashes back to the university building by a roundabout route, keeping to the shadows. But it was too late.</p>
    <p>A couple of blocks away, a night patrol was silently moving down a parallel street. The city's darkness could temporarily hide an intruder from the corporation's electronic eyes, but not forever. Two Corporation soldiers, clad in massive exoskeleton armor, strode between the sleeping buildings.  Servomotors hummed with each step, the rubberized soles thudding rhythmically against the pavement.  The sound of their footsteps echoed hollowly from the shop windows and concrete walls of the deserted street.</p>
    <p>Sergeant Vincent Drake had been in a foul mood for the past few days. He moved silently, deftly, almost cat-like for such a seemingly heavy man: the armor became his second skin, once he concentrated. The Sergeant continuously scanned the surrounding darkness with his helmet visor, carefully examining every archway and alley for the slightest signs of movement.</p>
    <p>His new partner, Private Higgs, was a rookie, and silence was much harder for him. The monotonous march in cumbersome armor caused him anxiety. To dispel the growing unease, Higgs looked around and, gathering his courage, quietly spoke first: "Sir… This exoskeleton armor is like a second skin for you, isn't it? You move so easily…" the private's voice sounded uncertain, muffled, under the helmet's mask.</p>
    <p>Drake cast a brief glance at his partner and reluctantly replied in a low, even tone: "Watch yourself, not the armor. Learn to control yourself—and it will stop hindering your movements."</p>
    <p>Higgs nodded and fell silent. He had heard about Drake's reputation: professional, veteran—such men didn't need unnecessary chatter. The recruit swallowed and focused on the route, forcing away thoughts of the irritable sergeant. For some time, they moved in complete silence, broken only by the muffled hum of servomotors and the clatter of magnetic boots. The patrol only had to wait for the end of their shift—nothing was happening. Street gangs, at least those that remained, didn't risk going out, fearing patrols.</p>
    <p>But suddenly, the night's stillness was cut by a sound: somewhere ahead, on their course, a distant thud echoed, as if something heavy had crashed to the ground. Drake instantly raised his hand, signaling to stop. Both froze, listening. For a few seconds, a ringing silence reigned again. And in it, an echo could be heard—a short screech and a rumble, reflected off the walls. Higgs stared warily into the thick darkness ahead.</p>
    <p>"You hear that, sir?" he whispered, completely forgetting their recent conversation. The Sergeant did not reply. He was already switching his helmet visor to thermal imaging mode. Drake's gaze swept the street to the nearest intersection. Ordinary optics showed only pitch blackness ahead. But in the infrared spectrum, the sergeant clearly saw a bright, non-stationary heat signature—for a moment, it flickered between the buildings about forty meters away. As if someone—or something—had quickly crossed the street further down.</p>
    <p>"Contact," Drake said quietly. "One. Moving fast." No sooner had he spoken than a silhouette appeared in the thermal imager's field of view. At the far intersection, crossing it sideways, a dark gray figure glided. And it moved so swiftly and smoothly that at first, Drake thought it was a person on rollerblades. The silhouette literally flew above the ground, almost not touching the pavement. The Sergeant narrowed his eyes, increasing the magnification and applying different filters. The thermogram clearly showed a human body, but… strange. No usual warm trail was left under the target—the asphalt beneath it didn't heat up from steps, as if the soles weren't touching the ground at all.</p>
    <p>"My God, is he flying?" Higgs blurted out, who also saw the anomaly through his visor. "Looks like it…" Drake muttered, switching the spectrum analyzer. Laser rangefinder, ultrasound, field readings—the instruments detected something, but couldn't identify the nature of the phenomenon. And it didn't matter now: curfew, unauthorized person on the street—intruder, period. "Pursue," the sergeant commanded curtly.</p>
    <p>Both soldiers surged forward simultaneously. The night's silence was cut by the roar of accelerating servomotors. The exoskeletons switched to  power-assist  mode: limb amplifiers brought power to maximum. Drake crouched and broke into a run—his seemingly cumbersome armor gained terrifying speed with each passing second. Higgs, trying to keep up, also engaged his boosters. Sparks flew from under their heavy boots as they gripped the steel elements of the pavement with magnets for better traction. The patrol sped down the empty street, aiming at the receding, indistinct shadow ahead.</p>
    <p>Max heard them a second before he saw them. First, an incomprehensible metallic hum reached his ears, growing behind him—an alien noise amidst the night's silence. He tensed, slowed his run, glancing over his shoulder. What was that? A motor? Footsteps? An echo of his own fall? His heart thumped, skipping a beat. And then he saw them: in the distance, from the black maw of the street behind him, two massive figures rapidly approached. In the glints of the lanterns, the outlines of armor gleamed, and sensors on their helmets flickered like crimson dots. Even from a distance, it was clear who they were: the corporation, a patrol.</p>
    <p>"Patrol! Already here…" flashed like lightning through Max's mind. He froze for only a moment. Then instinct took over.  Run for his life.  Max sharply turned and bolted, with all his might. The fields on his legs and arms, almost without thinking, he switched back to  glide  mode—speed was the main thing now. But it didn't help. Behind him, with the speed of an approaching train, a monstrous clatter grew: it was the patrol's armored boots hitting the asphalt, catching up to him frighteningly fast. Panic gave Max a burst of speed. He hurtled down the street, desperately pushing off with his fields again and again, striving to increase his speed. His movements were chaotic, but fast; adrenaline sharpened every nerve cell. It felt like another second—and the steel monster would clamp its fists around his throat. He felt their approach with his whole body, as if a scorching gaze from a visor was burning his back.</p>
    <p>To his right, a narrow alley flashed by—a dark slit between buildings. Without a moment's hesitation, Max sharply veered into it, almost flying, activating the  glide  fields on his hands, and sliding along the concrete wall of the building on the turn as if it were a sidewalk. He barely kept his feet, but continued to run. His maneuver saved him and bought him a few precious seconds. The armored patrol, carried by inertia, swept past the alley and was forced to turn around and come back. Unlike him, the patrol couldn’t glide along walls. That gave Max an edge—and he made a mental note of it.</p>
    <p>Forward and deeper—there was darkness and a labyrinth of interconnected courtyards. Exactly what he needed. Narrow passages between buildings promised nothing good for men in bulky exoskeletons: the heavy patrols would have to slow down and squeeze through. Max dashed through the winding alley, weaving between dirty containers and concrete barriers, increasing his maneuverability by pushing off the walls with the fields on his hands.</p>
    <p>Behind him, the pursuers burst into the alley opening. A beam of white light flew up the walls, picking out Max's leaping shadow from the darkness. "Stop!" a commanding shout, amplified many times by a loudspeaker, echoed throughout the narrow passage. Sergeant Drake no longer saw the point in hiding. His hoarse voice struck like an electric shock: "Stop, or we'll shoot!" He raised his rifle, and the runner was in his sights. The thought flashed through his mind: "Kill a man for running away? For just being on the street and violating a ridiculous curfew? Or for running fast on some strange kind of rollerblades?" Higgs ran past him. Drake lowered his rifle. "No, maybe just catch him and look at this runner." And he accelerated again.</p>
    <p>In response to the warning shot, there was only a sharp clang—Max, without slowing down, activated the field, enhancing his jump, and leaped over an overturned dumpster, kicking the lid with full force.</p>
    <p>The metal round lid tore off and flew back, clanging against the legs of the first pursuer. Higgs gasped in surprise and stumbled, instinctively recoiling. The exoskeleton armor, of course, withstood such an impact without harm, but the recruit himself lost a few precious seconds recovering.</p>
    <p>Drake didn't stop for a moment: crouching, he lunged forward alone, and the heavy thuds of his steps sounded even more intense. Max burst from the alley onto another street. It turned out to be significantly wider. And a few seconds later, with a heavy rumble, his first pursuer erupted from the alley. Max ran so fast that the air whistled in his ears, and his heart pounded from the exertion. But in the open space, the man in armor relentlessly gained on him. A shadow flickered behind him—heavy, relentless,  like a juggernaut crammed into a shoebox alley.  Max felt the pursuer was very close now: the mechanical growl of the exoskeleton resonated almost intimately from his side and behind him. Don't look back!</p>
    <p>Seeing a sharp turn ahead—a courtyard turning left, around the corner of a building—Max made a split-second decision. Left! Only by maneuvering could he break away. Turning at full speed was unthinkable: too narrow, and inertia would inevitably carry him straight into the wall. But there was no time to stop either. Max acted on instinct.  He threw himself into the turn, body coiled like a spring, aiming for survival more than grace.  Simultaneously throwing his left palm forward, directly onto the brick wall, and instantly switched the field on his palm to maximum  adhesion  mode.  His palm slapped the wall—the field caught, shrieked, twisted his body with a jolt—and he was through.  Then he immediately flew into the turn at speed, trying to slide along the wall with his right hand and right leg.</p>
    <p>The man in armor couldn't repeat this dizzying trick. When Max bounced around the corner, he tried with all his might to brake. The asphalt under the patrolman's feet erupted in a shower of sparks—the enormous mass of armor shrieked, scraping against the stone, trying to stop. But the speed was too great: failing to make the turn, he overshot the courtyard entrance, almost tipping sideways. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the fleeting shadow of his target already in the side opening. Drake cursed angrily and slammed his fist into the wall. The facing tiles on the facade shattered. "Damn!" he bellowed into the radio channel, turning his heavy armor. "Higgs, to me! He's going along the eighth house, past the left wing!"</p>
    <p>The private, out of breath, finally caught up with his partner. Drake was already picking up speed again, servomotors creaking, now on a parallel street on the other side of the block. Higgs's head was buzzing: everything was happening at a frantic pace. In the first seconds of the chase, he barely kept up with the sergeant's actions—and now he had completely lost sight of the fugitive. "How is that even possible?!" he thought feverishly, moving onto a wide path along the houses. The target had disappeared somewhere into the labyrinth of courtyards, the sergeant miraculously hadn't broken his neck while turning… And he, Higgs, was just getting in the veteran's way. Gritting his teeth in frustration, the private dashed after him, trying to stay close.</p>
    <p>Max, meanwhile, flew forward in zigzags through dark alleys. He no longer knew where he was—he had dashed through several courtyards, sped under some awnings, leaped over a low iron fence. Anything to get away. His lungs burned, his chest ached from the exertion, but he dared not stop for a second. Ahead, another archway appeared, beyond it—a faintly lit street. Max aimed to jump from turn to turn; the narrower the alley and the more obstacles it had, the better, he would jump over them, while the armored men would have to go around each time. He himself didn't understand how he got away.</p>
    <p>At some point, the sound of the chase behind him quieted. But Max, by inertia, kept running and running until he realized he was about to collapse. He saw a fire escape at the second-floor level and jumped, boosting his leap with the fields. He quietly climbed onto the roof of a five-story building and sat down, leaning his back against the parapet and listening.</p>
    <p>"Target lost," Sergeant Drake reported evenly, surveying the empty street. Anger was clearly evident in his voice beneath the helmet's modulator. "Check the thermal imager. Maybe he's hiding nearby."</p>
    <p>"Strange," Higgs mumbled a moment later. "I don't see anything. Why didn't you shoot, sir?"</p>
    <p>"You were in the line of fire."</p>
    <p>Drake hesitated. His gaze roamed predatorily over facades, cornices, dark archways of entrances. An experienced hunter felt in his skin that his prey was very close—just as a minute ago Max had felt the gaze of the chase on his back. The Sergeant reluctantly lowered his scanner, but continued to look around distrustfully. Finally, Drake cursed under his breath and lowered his rifle. His visor clicked and smoothly slid upwards, revealing an angry, tense face. It seemed the sergeant didn't trust the instruments—the target's movement seemed too incredible. But he had little time: at any moment, operational command could demand a report on what noise the patrol had caused.</p>
    <p>"He got away," Drake hissed through clenched teeth, his gaze fixed on the dark wall. "Damn ghost…" "Should we go back?" Higgs asked uncertainly, still sweeping his sensor over nearby roofs.</p>
    <p>Drake nodded silently and lowered his visor back down. "Yes. It's empty here," he said quietly. As a farewell, the sergeant took a few steps along the building, carefully looking at his feet—there were indeed no traces on the asphalt, as if no one had just run down that street. Only near the low curb were faint scratches and bits of bitumen, knocked out of the pavement—likely traces from their armor boots during abrupt braking. Drake paused for another second and turned to his partner: "And, Higgs… Not a word to anyone. Understood?" Higgs nodded quickly. He couldn't even imagine how to explain to command that they had been chasing a flying man. The patrol moved back, disappearing into the archway from which they had burst a minute ago. For a long time, the heavy thud of their footsteps echoed hollowly somewhere in the alleys, until everything quieted down again and returned to its former sleepy silence.</p>
    <p>His heart thundered—slow, brutal, like it wanted out of his chest.  He leaned against the cold wall, trying somehow to calm his frantic pulse.  His body shook—not from fear anymore, but the crash after adrenaline.  "What the hell am I doing?" he whispered into the dark, ashamed to hear his own voice. He clenched his fingers into fists, feeling the tension give way to exhaustion, and his body seemed to turn into a heavy burden that barely obeyed him. Again, scenes of his crazy flight flashed before his eyes—the flickering walls, the clang of dumpsters, the blinding flashes of the pursuers' lights. And again came the terrible realization:  One drone, one mistake—and this whole flight would be a joke told at his funeral.  "Professor warned me…"  he thought with bitterness.  Blinov's voice clearly sounded in his head, persistent and strict: "Any power requires responsibility. Every step forward is a step on the edge, where a mistake costs too much." Max closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, trying to banish the memories. He was alive, he had survived, but the very fact that he had so easily stepped into the abyss scared him more than the chase itself. He could have died at any moment: a bullet in the back, a miscalculated jump, a fall at breakneck speed—each scenario was no longer hypothetical—it was disturbingly real. The realization of his own vulnerability pierced him with cold.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, something deep inside him began to awaken. He remembered the feeling of gliding above the ground, as if overcoming gravity itself. He remembered how perfectly the  adhesion  and  glide  fields worked, how precisely he calculated the trajectory, and how instantly he adapted to the circumstances. These were not just lucky coincidences—it was proof that the technology worked, and his ideas were viable. And if he could create a field capable of such maneuvering, it meant he could also create protection against bullets and other threats. The thought brought a strange mixture of pride and calm, as if he had seen a lighthouse in a dark night. Yes, he was vulnerable now, but the potential of his discoveries seemed almost limitless.</p>
    <p>"I need a protective field," he whispered to himself. "A field capable of withstanding a shot…" This thought settled within him with astonishing clarity. To go further down this path, he would have to become stronger, smarter, and more cautious. Every move had to be calculated in advance, every risk—carefully weighed. Repeating such madness without preparation would be pure suicide. Today he was lucky—and to rely on luck again would be the height of foolishness. Max exhaled, straightened up, and looked at the night sky. A resolute fire burned in his eyes, which did not extinguish even under the weight of realizing the risk.</p>
    <p>"No more foolishness," he said firmly, addressing himself and the night's darkness. "But I won't give up power. I will become stronger. I must become stronger." He was exhausted, scared, and at the same time intoxicated by his newfound power. The call of power was irresistible—and retreat was not in his nature.</p>
