        <h1>Chapter 30. Answers and Decisions</h1>

        <p>The warm hush that had settled over the shelter didn’t last.</p>
        <p>Lis was the one who broke it.</p>
        <p>There was something sharp in the way she moved — like she’d just shrugged off a cloak of reflection that had grown too heavy.</p>
        <p>“Alright. Enough philosophy.”</p>
        <p>She turned to Max, arms crossed, and her eyes pinned him where he sat — calm, unblinking, merciless.</p>
        <p>“So tell me: why did you scale forty-three stories of sheer concrete just to crash into a corporate data center? Were you that desperate to see me again?”</p>
        <p>Max exhaled, running a hand through his hair, the ghost of adrenaline still clinging to his skin. The weight of the past few hours bore down on his shoulders.</p>
        <p>“I was trying to get inside… figure out who ordered the professor’s abduction,” he said. “But then I ran into you. And, well — things went a little sideways.”</p>
        <p>His voice trailed off. His gaze drifted.</p>
        <p>The file he’d stolen — it was the only thing he had left. The final thread still tying him to the truth.</p>
        <p>“I’ve got a video,” he said quietly. “Security feed. The person who gave the order — they’re on it. I don’t know who they are… but maybe you will.”</p>
        <p>Lis’s expression didn’t change, but something flickered in her eyes — hope, too brittle to hold. Pain, raw and barely hidden.</p>
        <p>“This could change everything,” she said. “If we find my father… He knew the corporation inside and out. He could’ve helped.”</p>
        <p>Her voice caught — just a hitch — before she shut it down again. Lips pressed into a line sharp enough to cut.</p>
        <p>Lawrence watched her in silence, then turned to Max, his gaze weighing unspoken calculations.</p>
        <p>“You think they’re holding them together?” he asked her. His voice was low, edged with something close to dread.</p>
        <p>“It’s possible,” Lis answered. “We don’t know enough.”</p>
        <p>Lawrence sighed and dragged a hand down his face, as if trying to wipe away the exhaustion etched into it.</p>
        <p>“Then we start tomorrow. First thing.” He looked around the room. His tone was firm now, decisive. “Tonight — we rest. Tomorrow, we work.”</p>
        <p>He turned to Max.</p>
        <p>“You staying? We’ve got some rooms.”</p>
        <p>Max hesitated. His mind still hovered in survival mode — weighing exits, calculating risk. But deep down, something else made the decision for him.</p>
        <p>“Yeah,” he said. “I think I should. After everything that’s happened… I doubt the corporation isn’t already hunting for me.”</p>
        <p>“Smart call.” Lawrence clapped a hand on his shoulder — part welcome, part contract.</p>
        <p>But Lis didn’t move. Her eyes were fixed now on a different door — the one behind which Green had been locked away. Her stance had shifted. Still and silent, she radiated a dangerous kind of focus.</p>
        <p>“Not until we question the traitor.”</p>
        <p>The lights overhead gave a faint sizzle. Somewhere deep in the bunker, the generator throbbed like a mechanical heartbeat.</p>
        <p>She turned and strode across the room, flinging open the door. The space beyond was dim, stale, unwelcoming. The kind of silence that keeps its secrets.</p>
        <p>Lis stepped inside. Max followed, slower.</p>
        <p>Royce planted himself in the doorway, arms crossed. He said nothing — didn’t need to. His eyes tracked everything.</p>
        <p>In the corner, slumped against the wall, sat Green.</p>
        <p>The expensive suit he’d worn like armor was stained now, disheveled. His face was pale. His eyes… empty. Whatever defiance he’d carried was long gone. What remained was a man waiting for judgment.</p>
        <p>“I know I’m done,” he rasped. His voice was brittle, cracking like paper. “The corporation doesn’t forgive failure. They’ll erase me. If you don’t do it first.”</p>
        <p>He leaned his head back against the wall, like he could disappear into it.</p>
        <p>Lis crouched in front of him — not threatening, not gentle. Her voice was soft. Almost affectionate. But it rang with something metallic beneath.</p>
        <p>“Then make your last act useful,” she said. “Talk.”</p>
        <p>Green swallowed hard. His throat worked like he was trying to choke down fear.</p>
        <p>“I… I didn’t have a choice. I just did what they told me…”</p>
        <p>“Where is my father?”</p>
        <p>Her voice sliced through his like a blade — tight, trembling with tension. For a moment, her expression cracked. Grief, maybe. Or fury. But it vanished just as fast.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” Green said, voice barely audible. “They said he was sent for correction, but… I wasn’t told where.”</p>
        <p>His hands trembled. He clutched at his collar like a drowning man.</p>
        <p>“I swear.”</p>
        <p>The last word broke out of him — raw, desperate.</p>
        <p>Lis studied him. And then, without a word, she drove her boot into his ribs.</p>
        <p>The sound was dull, intimate. Like something important breaking.</p>
        <p>Green gasped and folded in half, too shocked to scream. He didn’t even raise a hand to defend himself. Just curled up, trembling.</p>
        <p>Royce didn’t flinch. He gave the smallest of nods — not approval, not condemnation. Just inevitability.</p>
        <p>Green slowly uncurled. His face contorted, not just with pain — with shame.</p>
        <p>“I… deserved that.”</p>
        <p>Max, still standing in the background, felt something twist in him.</p>
        <p>He wasn’t prepared for this — for Lis’s cold precision, her surgical violence.</p>
        <p>He stepped forward, switched on the projector. The screen lit up inches from Green’s face.</p>
        <p>A grainy video flickered to life: a man in a tailored suit, face pale and sharp. His voice was silent, but his lips moved with purpose, issuing orders through a headset.</p>
        <p>The image was just clear enough to make out the features.</p>
        <p>“Do you recognize him?” Max asked. His tone was flat. Not accusing — just absolute.</p>
        <p>Green froze. His eyes widened. And in that moment, Max saw a fear that couldn’t be faked.</p>
        <p>“Friedrich Steiner…” Green’s voice collapsed into a whisper. “Oh god.”</p>
        <p>Max narrowed his gaze. He didn’t know the name — but the reaction told him everything.</p>
        <p>“Who is he?”</p>
        <p>Green’s mouth opened. Closed. Then finally:</p>
        <p>“A monster. One of their top field operatives. The kind who smiles while he kills. The kind even the board’s afraid of. But the worst part…”</p>
        <p>His voice dropped to a whisper.</p>
        <p>“He reports directly to Iris.”</p>
        <p>The name hit the room like a bullet.</p>
        <p>Max didn’t speak. He didn’t have to.</p>
        <p>Because suddenly, all the threads pulled taut. All the warnings, the shadows, the rumors — they all led to her.</p>
        <p>Iris.</p>
        <p>The woman with the frozen face. The one people didn’t dare name.</p>
        <p>And now, her name was in Max’s path.</p>
        <p>There would be no going around it. No going back.</p>
