        <h1>Chapter 39. Arms Race</h1>

        <p>Max sat alone in the dark, staring at the edge of his trophy blade. His thoughts drifted in that hazy place between sleep and waking. Yesterday’s fight, the pain in his arm, the sick realization that the enemy now wielded their technology—he tried to push it all aside, but it kept crawling back.</p>
        <p>He kept replaying the moment his strike was parried. When two field surfaces collided, they didn’t pass through each other. A shield was simply a special configuration of spatial waves.</p>
        <p>“Wave nodes…” he murmured.</p>
        <p>The energy waves forming a shield behaved like a standing wave—zones of stability where energy pooled and held. But what if—</p>
        <p>Then it hit him. If a second oscillating layer were introduced in counter-phase, the nodes would cancel out. The blade would slice through the shield like it wasn’t there.</p>
        <p>Though in that moment, the blade itself would lose coherence—cease to exist as a blade.</p>
        <p>“Eureka!” he roared at the top of his lungs.</p>
        <p>The door banged open. Royce stormed in with a combat knife in hand, ready for a fight. Behind him, Lis appeared in the doorway, blinking, disoriented.</p>
        <p>“Why the hell are you screaming like someone’s gutting you alive?” Royce asked, catching his breath.</p>
        <p>“Bad dreams from yesterday?” Lis added, concern in her voice.</p>
        <p>“No!” Max jumped to his feet, brandishing the blade. “I figured it out! If we layer a second wave onto the blade’s field in perfect counter-phase, it’ll cancel out their shield right at the point of contact!”</p>
        <p>Lis frowned. “Okay, how about in a language normal people speak?”</p>
        <p>“Picture a pool,” Max raised his hand, mimicking ripples. “You drop a stone—waves spread out. Now imagine generating an opposite wave, same shape but inverted—crest meets trough, they cancel each other out.”</p>
        <p>Lis blinked, slowly nodding. “So… you wanna do that with force fields?”</p>
        <p>“Exactly!” Max pointed triumphantly at the sword. “We sync the field to within nanoseconds, and it’ll cut through any barrier like it isn’t even there!”</p>
        <p>Royce let out a low whistle. “Damn, kid. You’re a walking arms race.”</p>
        <p>Max gave a half-smile. “Now I just have to make it actually work…”</p>
        <p>He shut himself in, leaving the outside world behind. In his hands, he held something rare: Steiner’s blade-sword, far more advanced than his own prototype. Its power cell was ten times stronger, built with cutting-edge corporate engineering.</p>
        <p>And he was going to need every drop of that power. A lot of it.</p>
        <p>He ran his finger along the blade’s smooth surface, mentally cycling through options. Creating a second wave layer would require doubling the energy. His original sword would’ve drained in minutes. But this one… this one had a fighting chance.</p>
        <p>“Damn… if only I had my old university lab right now…” he muttered.</p>
        <p>But the university was likely under full corporate control by now. No one else would be allowed near the tech. They’d bury it. And Max—he was the only one left outside the Corporation who truly understood how it worked.</p>
        <p>He grimaced. That meant the hunt for him was only going to get worse.</p>
        <p>Grinding his teeth, he focused. Precise calibration, near-zero error margin. Every adjustment counted. Slowly, through trial and error, he brought the blade’s field into stable counter-phase alignment with a standard shield signature.</p>
        <p>He struck.</p>
        <p>The blade passed through the barrier as if it didn’t exist.</p>
        <p>“Yes…” he breathed.</p>
        <p>And then a new thought crept in.</p>
        <p>What about a third layer?</p>
        <p>In theory, stacking multiple counter-phase fields could enhance both offense and defense. It could open the door to a new kind of battlefield—a clash of blades and barriers, leveled up to extremes. Whoever mastered it first would control the outcome.</p>
        <p>Max’s eyes lit up. He smirked.</p>
        <p>“Lis! Royce!” he shouted down the hallway. “Bring me your toys—it’s upgrade time!”</p>
