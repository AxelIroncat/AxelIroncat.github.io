        <h1>Chapter 36: The Art of War</h1>

        <p>Max limped through the collector tunnels.Master Yamaguchi had led him to a safe entry point and vanished, silent as ever.</p>
        <p>They had escaped the trap — but Max's thoughts grew darker with every step.The Corporation had found a way to force the Professor to cooperate.Now they would have an army protected by dynamic spatial fields — and weapons strong enough to shatter any defense.They had the resources to produce as many as they wanted, however powerful. Enough to seize the world.</p>
        <p>Maybe after that, peace would follow.An age of prosperity.An age of control.No freedom.Would humanity survive it?</p>
        <p>Then again, empires with absolute power had existed before.And humanity lived on. Even evolved.Maybe the Corporation was just another empire. And empires always fall — eventually.</p>
        <p>But wait. If there's no external threat… empires fall from within.A crisis of power.But what if technology made that crisis impossible?What if the ruler could live centuries… or never die?</p>
        <p>Then there’d be no succession crisis.No instability.Just more time — more time for control to root itself deep.But eventually… destabilizing forces always appear. Don’t they?</p>
        <p>Maybe it’s not worth resisting.After all, the Corporation needed him.Probably for his mind.</p>
        <p>But they already had the Professor.Maybe Max only needed to disappear — to keep the technology from falling into the hands of competitors.</p>
        <p>Still, maybe the Professor would put in a word for him.His intellect could be useful. To someone.</p>
        <p>Lis.Without her, none of it mattered.Nothing meant anything.</p>
        <p>But maybe he could make a deal.She and her father posed no real threat to Iris.They could live in peace — in a house by the sea — while the world tore itself apart in a war for global control.</p>
        <p>Stop.You’re thinking like it’s already lost.Like you’ve already surrendered.</p>
        <p>Don’t focus on the problem.Focus on how to break it.</p>
        <p><i>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.If you know yourself but not the enemy, you will win one and lose one.If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will lose every battle.”</i>¹</p>
        <p>Do I know myself?Good question.</p>
        <p>I’m trying to.The Professor used to say — we are those who seek Truth.And if it’s true that the one who seeks is closer to truth than the one who claims to have found it…Then the person who thinks they know themselves might be further from the truth than the one still searching.</p>
        <p>So where does that leave me?Nowhere yet.In between.</p>
        <p>Some people "know" themselves, but deny their weakness — and that means they don’t know themselves at all.Maybe I’ll need to come back to this one.</p>
        <p>Let’s flip the angle.</p>
        <p>Do I know the Corporation?</p>
        <p>Green said Iris <i>is</i> the Corporation.</p>
        <p>So… do I know Iris?What drives her?</p>
        <p>Power.She wants power.</p>
        <p>And me?</p>
        <p>I wanted it too. Not over people. Over <i>reality</i> .Control. Precision.When you leap across rooftops and every movement is your own — that’s power over space.</p>
        <p>And that power came from my devices.Because without them… I had none.</p>
        <p>I’m not strong.I just didn’t want to be weak anymore.</p>
        <p>Power becomes a stand-in for strength.A way to convince yourself you’re strong.And then you believe in it.Believe in strength that doesn’t exist.</p>
        <p>That’s it — <i>belief</i> .</p>
        <p>Belief feeds power.</p>
        <p>Power, strength, belief —They’ve always been tangled together. Always part of the same equation.</p>
        <p>Could I give up my devices — my power over space?</p>
        <p>He pulled the broken hilt from his pocket.</p>
        <p>No.Probably not.</p>
        <p>That was strength.That was safety.That was freedom.</p>
        <p>And yet, the Professor had once convinced him to dismantle it all.To promise not to use it.</p>
        <p>How?</p>
        <p>With a single, iron argument:</p>
        <p>If you don’t give it up — something greater will come and take it from you.</p>
        <p>There it is.</p>
        <p>That’s what drives anyone who has power.The fear of losing it.</p>
        <p>And the need to grow it — to hold onto it.</p>
        <p>Doesn’t matter if it’s strength, wealth, or belief.All of it counts as power.And the more of it someone has — the more they dream of making it absolute.</p>
        <p><i>“Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”</i>²</p>
        <p>So what could ever cure a person like that?</p>
        <p>Hypothetically?Take their power away.Or at least show them something greater.Something strong enough to scare them.</p>
        <p>That might be enough to make them rethink everything.</p>
        <p>Iris Tanaka.</p>
        <p>I see you now.</p>
        <p>The war isn’t lost.</p>
