        <h1>Chapter 43. In Danger</h1>

        <p>The professor sat alone at his large desk in the laboratory, immersed in his notes. The room was silent, but the air was taut—like a drawn string. He kept rereading the same line in his calculations, searching for a flaw. But there was none. His mind was operating with flawless precision, calculating variations in fractions of a second. And yet—something was wrong. The clarity brought no satisfaction. It didn’t inspire. It brought only a dull, crushing emptiness.</p>
        <p>The neural implant had long become part of his cognition—a seamless augmentation that accelerated analysis, filtered emotional noise, and streamlined logic chains. He barely noticed it anymore. Almost. His emotions hadn’t been erased, but dulled—filtered down to a faint background hum, leaving only a cold, alien lucidity. It wasn’t his own indifference—it had been imposed. And he felt it like a subtle but constant vibration just beyond the edge of awareness, like a foreign pulse coursing through his veins.</p>
        <p>But now… the emptiness flinched.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, without warning, an image burst in his mind—vivid, commanding, penetrating. Her. He didn’t hear her voice. He didn’t see her face. He felt her. His gray existence erupted in blinding color—like blood rushing back to a numb limb. His heart swelled—with joy, with fear, with a trembling awe. It wasn’t a command. It was an intrusion.</p>
        <p>And then her melodic voice flowed through his consciousness, like an invisible hand brushing across his neurons:</p>
        <p>“Darling. Come to me. Now.”</p>
        <p>At the sound of her tone, his heart plummeted. Everything else vanished. He rushed toward the elevator. There was something unbearably intimate in that silent summons through the implant. Not a threat. Not an order. An expectation. And an absolute certainty in her right to demand. That was more terrifying than rage.</p>
        <p>He couldn’t say what pulled him to her—fear, reverence, or the lingering residue of that “correction” he'd undergone at the corporate center. Or maybe it was the implant itself—now inseparable from all his work. But that no longer mattered. Around her, life returned—distorted, taut, always on the brink of collapse beneath her gaze. His every motion was automatic, as if the architecture of the building itself was guiding his body.</p>
        <p>The elevator doors slid open, and he stepped into her domain. Iris’s office—vaulted ceilings like a cathedral, panoramic windows overlooking the laboratory far below, sprawling like a vast, silent schematic. Her desk stood in the center of the upper tier, shrouded in shadow. Everything here exuded grandeur and control, calculated so precisely that the slightest deviation would feel like sacrilege.</p>
        <p>He entered. Iris sat behind her desk. Her eyes met his—cold, level, unreadable—and a shiver ran down his spine. In her dark eyes glinted something still and inhuman. She showed no emotion, and yet her gaze made him feel like a speck of dust in her perfectly calibrated world. With a gesture, she motioned for him to sit. He obeyed, unable to shake the dread rising in his chest.</p>
        <p>Iris rose. Slowly circled the desk. Approached.</p>
        <p>Without a word, she ran a gloved hand softly over his head. The touch was cold—almost cruel—but strangely delicate, like she wasn’t touching a person, but a valuable instrument in need of calibration. Then, sharply, she seized a handful of his hair and tilted his head back, forcing him to meet her eyes.</p>
        <p>“You promised you wouldn’t fail me,” she said. Her voice was soft, but it cracked like a whip.</p>
        <p>He stared at her, stunned—unsure what had happened, only feeling his inner world compressing under her weight. Something heavy and suffocating was rising inside him—not just fear or pain, but a crushing ache of sorrow, almost physical: How could I have failed Her?</p>
        <p>“A report just came in,” she went on, “from the search unit commander. He was wearing our latest armor—fields and all. Apparently, your protégé’s little crew has a blade that cuts right through it. Even through plates protected by wave fields. Here—see for yourself.”</p>
        <p>She snapped her fingers. A large screen above the stairs came to life, showing an image of neatly sliced armor—mute evidence of his failure.</p>
        <p>He struggled to focus. Thoughts streamed like someone had yanked them out of darkness and laid them bare before him. But was it insight—or just the output of an algorithm he no longer owned?</p>
        <p>Mechanically, as if reciting a formula, he muttered:</p>
        <p>“That’s not possible… The field is formed from spatial wave nodes… nothing can cross a node unless…”</p>
        <p>Suddenly his eyes went wide. The realization struck like a flash of blinding white across his mind. Diagrams and equations began flickering through his head, aligning themselves at breakneck speed. It wasn’t thinking. It was acceleration—driven by the implant, now working at full capacity to fulfill Her will.</p>
        <p>He went on, not knowing whether the thought was his own or implanted—but it felt entirely natural:</p>
        <p>“…unless it’s neutralized by a counter-phase wave…”</p>
        <p>And now that the logic clicked into place, he couldn’t help but marvel at the idea. It was… brilliant.</p>
        <p>“God… That kid’s a real genius,” he breathed. “I’d never have figured this out without him…”</p>
        <p>The words escaped before he could stop them.</p>
        <p>And then he remembered—he was before Her. The scientific wonder shriveled into ice-cold fear.</p>
        <p>Iris looked at him again. She studied him. Her voice turned sweet—dangerously so.</p>
        <p>“So—you’ll fix it?” she asked gently. But behind the melody, steel. “Immediately.”</p>
        <p>He answered at once, sensing just how much depended on his reply. His entire existence hung on her approval—on her grace.</p>
        <p>“Yes. Of course. I understand. I just need to run the numbers. I already see how to compensate.”</p>
        <p>She looked at him again. Her gaze hardened—piercing.</p>
        <p>“Do you understand what you just escaped?” she asked. “Or what you will escape—if I see results immediately.”</p>
        <p>He nodded. The emptiness inside him now had shape. But it wasn’t his own.</p>
        <p>“Then don’t waste another minute. Go.”</p>
        <p>He rose. Bowed low. Left.</p>
        <p>When the doors closed behind him, and her gaze vanished, he stood paralyzed—as if her gaze had been the only thing keeping him alive.</p>
        <p>All he felt was a desperate need to return and earn her approval. Not for safety. Not for advancement. But for the sheer chance to serve her.</p>
        <p>The implant was already feeding him formulas. His thoughts flowed.</p>
        <p>But none of it was for knowledge.</p>
        <p>Everything—was for Her.</p>
        <p>He had become the instrument of her will.</p>
        <p>And nothing else mattered.</p>
