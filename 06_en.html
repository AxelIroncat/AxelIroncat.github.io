        <h1>Chapter 6. Council of the Celestials</h1>
        <p>The "Kairo" corporation's board of directors' conference hall was located almost at the very top of the colossal tower. The oval-shaped hall protruded halfway out of the building's facade, with panoramic windows several stories high. In the center, a section of the floor was made of tempered glass: through it, a dizzying view opened up to the city, sprawling below like a glowing carpet of neon and steel. No ostentatious luxury — only cold elegance: a smooth black wooden table, built-in interfaces, chairs perfectly adjusted to each participant's parameters.</p>
        <p>Iris Tanaka stood by the window. Her silhouette, outlined against the metropolis's lights, was flawless: a black leather dress with a high slit, tightly fitting her figure, elbow-length gloves, a high collar. She didn't move; only a slight tension in her shoulders betrayed her readiness. When the board members entered, she merely nodded — briefly, reservedly, but in such a way that everyone felt she saw everything.</p>
        <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," Iris said, without turning around. Her voice was firm and calm. "We live at a turning point. The country's economy already relies on our infrastructure. It's time to state this openly — and solidify our position."</p>
        <p>She turned, her gaze sweeping over the faces of those gathered.</p>
        <p>"We are no longer obliged to submit to state mechanisms that don't work. The unrest in the capital is not chaos; it's a signal. People await force, order, and a clear center of control. We can provide this."</p>
        <p>"You propose… what?" said Richard Veil, a gray-haired man with an upright posture and a heavy, deep voice. He was one of the oldest board members, having worked with Iris's father from the very beginning. "To introduce our security service into public space? You understand how this will be perceived. The state monopoly on the use of force is fundamental. If we go beyond its limits, confrontation will begin."</p>
        <p>"Precisely," added May Lin, an elegant woman in a dark blue pantsuit, responsible for international relations. Her voice was soft but clear. "International observers won't let this pass. The press will tear us apart."</p>
        <p>"The press eats from our hands," Iris cut in calmly. "As for monopoly — I'll say it differently. The state can't cope. We offer help. And help is coming. We are not disrupting order — we are lending a hand."</p>
        <p>"Field tests of the exobody armor passed with flying colors long ago," interjected a young man with an American accent. Thomas Blaine, involved in promising technical projects, nervously tapped his fingers on the table but spoke confidently. "Combat effectiveness is many times higher than anything before. The security service has long been fully equipped with everything necessary, as far as I know."</p>
        <p>"Timely," said Kenji Saito, head of the security department, in a hoarse voice. He sat slightly in the shadows, with a stone face and a piercing gaze. "Disinformation flows in the network are growing. The security service has long been ready for real work. Control on the streets will only give us more leverage; we are tired of inaction."</p>
        <p>"This sounds like martial law," grumbled Veil. He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. "And what then? Will we start establishing control over parliament? Or perhaps dissolve it?"</p>
        <p>Iris slowly walked along the table.</p>
        <p>"You still think in terms of the old world, Richard. I — of the future. Forces that do not transform disappear. We are not going to fight the state. We have already become its core. According to our data, most government members are our allies. Some are directly funded by us. The rest simply want to survive."</p>
        <p>She paused for a moment, then added:</p>
        <p>"We will give them legitimacy. They — will give us the mandate."</p>
        <p>"A beautiful picture, darling," came the lazy voice of Igor Alexandrovich Volkov, a well-known oligarch, in an expensive unbuttoned jacket, sitting like a king. His reputation was full of dark spots, but he knew how to invest money at the right moment. "Just don't forget — even the strongest beast stumbles sometimes. I hope you've learned to fall gracefully."</p>
        <p>Iris looked at him, her face unchanged.</p>
        <p>"We will not fall," she said calmly. "We will become the vertical axis on which the country will rely."</p>
        <p>Silence hung in the hall. The city outside the windows seemed distant and obedient, as if it knew its fate was being decided. Iris approached the center of the hall and placed her hands on the edge of the table.</p>
        <p>"We have entered an era where weakness costs more than rigidity," she said calmly. "We are not offering a revolution. We are offering stability. And while others argue about legality, we are already acting."</p>
        <p>Richard Veil, still seated, shook his head.</p>
        <p>"You speak of stability, Iris, but you act with methods that will destroy trust. You are going to replace the system — and that means: remove control. Power without checks and balances will sooner or later begin to consume itself."</p>
        <p>"Power without results is nothing," she retorted. "People don't ask by what laws they are protected. They ask who can do it. We — can."</p>
        <p>"Yet you don't answer the main question," Veil added sharply. "Who gave you the mandate?"</p>
        <p>"The market itself gave it to me. Infrastructure, medicine, digital systems, security — all of this rests on us. Even food networks. If we withdraw — the country will halt. Is that not a mandate?"</p>
        <p>"That's influence," May Lin said softly but clearly. "Not power. You speak as if the state has disappeared."</p>
        <p>"It hasn't disappeared," Iris nodded. "But it has ceased to govern. And more and more often — it asks us for help. Help that we provide. Voluntarily. For now."</p>
        <p>Kenji Saito briefly added:</p>
        <p>"The state asks for protection. We provide it. And legitimization — is a matter of technique."</p>
        <p>Thomas Blaine, still tense, interjected:</p>
        <p>"Speaking of technique: the communication infrastructure is almost ready to launch a new protocol. If we gain access to municipal channels, integration will take weeks, maybe days, not months."</p>
        <p>Iris shifted her gaze to Veil.</p>
        <p>"But for some reason, it's you, Richard, who has consistently blocked such decisions. And precisely in those sectors where unrest has now flared up."</p>
        <p>Veil slowly sat back, his gaze darkening.</p>
        <p>"I was guided by principles of caution. Unlike you, I do not believe the corporation should replace the state."</p>
        <p>Iris moved closer and placed her gloved hands on his shoulders. Leaning closer to his ear, she said loudly, so everyone could hear:</p>
        <p>"Caution is one thing. But you held private meetings with Adam Lawrence, the leader of the opposition party. He openly accuses us of undermining the foundations of democracy. And you — a board member of my corporation — dine with him and discuss business. This raises questions."</p>
        <p>"Adam is my friend," Veil said coldly. "And not everything that happens outside these walls is a conspiracy."</p>
        <p>"Quite possibly," Iris calmly agreed. "That's why I'm announcing an internal investigation. Until it's concluded, you are suspended from participating in the board and temporarily relieved of your executive position."</p>
        <p>Veil stood again, slowly. His eyes flashed a steely gaze.</p>
        <p>"You fear the old school. You fear those who remember what this corporation used to be."</p>
        <p>"I am not afraid," Iris said quietly. "I simply do not allow the weak to hinder progress."</p>
        <p>She pressed a button on the panel. Two guards entered the hall.</p>
        <p>"You're going to lock me up?" he asked, not averting his gaze.</p>
        <p>"Yes," Iris replied curtly. "Until the investigation is complete."</p>
        <p>He nodded. No scene. Only as he exited, he lingered on Thomas Green. There was disappointment in his eyes.</p>
        <p>The doors closed. Iris turned to the board:</p>
        <p>"From this moment, Veil's duties will be temporarily taken over by Green. Thomas, I count on your loyalty and precise execution."</p>
        <p>"Of course," he replied, bowing his head reservedly.</p>
        <p>Volkov smirked:</p>
        <p>"You truly don't waver, darling. Straight to the throat, like in the good old days. I'm starting to think you're even more dangerous than your father."</p>
        <p>"His time has passed," Iris said. "Mine — is just beginning."</p>
        <p>May Lin calmly raised her head:</p>
        <p>"According to the latest poll, 84% of citizens feel safer next to live soldiers, not drones or people in impenetrable armor."</p>
        <p>She paused.</p>
        <p>"I think we should minimize the number of drones on the streets. Let our fighters among civilians walk with open visors. Let the face of the new order be human."</p>
        <p>Iris nodded slightly.</p>
        <p>"Agreed. Today we have opened a new chapter. And no one will say anymore that the corporation is not ready for the challenges of the time."</p>
